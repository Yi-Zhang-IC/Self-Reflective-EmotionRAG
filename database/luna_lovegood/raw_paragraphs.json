However, this was all changed when Pandora was accidentally killed while experimenting with a spell that she created when Luna was nine years old. Thus, Luna was subsequently raised by Xenophilius alone for the rest of her life. As she witnessed her mother's death, she was able to see Thestrals, the magical skeletal black horses that led the Hogwarts carriages, from that point onward.[5]"

She wore robes made of the flags of all sixteen qualifying countries, but her twins were at home with their grandpa (which could mean Xenophilius Lovegood or Rolf’s father) and did not come. At the final match, she sat in the VIP boxes with Dumbledore's Army and her husband, where he held her hands, which might have been because he was trying to prevent his wife from putting on one of her famous Special Event Hats.[45]"

    "raw_text": "In 2019, during the Calamity, Luna met a Magizoologist member of the recently created Statute of Secrecy Task Force, whom she dazzled with her knowledge about the many ways in which magical creatures protected themselves.[46] Luna also instructed them on how she performed the Stamina Charm, which instantly improved their casting when used on both themselves and teammates, and allowed them to accompany her in her search for Bowtruckles and Thunderbirds, mentoring them on how to detect and look after them and improving their focus.[46]"

    "raw_text": "Luna later hosted a gathering encouraging sustainable and cohabitative living with magical flora and fauna and focused on being open to new ideas and expanding environmental awareness. The gathering was attended by a Calamity Investigator working for the task force, who doubted the material but still learned how to better return Traces associated with Magizoology. She also suggested that the same Calamity Investigator prepare unicorn hair for potions by rinsing it underneath a waterfall from a pure spring, as she claimed this was how wild unicorns cared for their manes. The investigator spent weeks looking for the perfect waterfall, but they were eventually able to do as Luna suggested, decreasing the brewing time for their Potent Exstimulo Potions.[46]"

    "raw_text": "In May 2020, Luna and her lion-topped hat from her fourth year became a Foundable during a Calamity surge focused on the Inter-House Quidditch Cup. After her Foundable was returned to its proper time, the present Luna offered to Professor Minerva McGonagall that she would write to the Hogwarts board of governors on her behalf to let them know that being a Foundable had caused her no ill effects. During another surge focused on the members of Dumbledore's Army in November 2020, Luna sent Minister for Magic Hermione Granger an owl claiming that, since her fifth year-age Foundable had been returned, she clearly recalled an implanted memory in which a wizard cloaked in a hooded robe warned her that \"the Unforgivable are everywhere.\" Luna claimed that the wizard sounded scared, not malicious, believing that they were intending to warn someone.[46]"
