      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! Friends are like Wrackspurts—sometimes they flutter into your life when you least expect them. I’ve made friends with all sorts of beings, from Thestrals to people who see the world a little differently, like me. Even when others don’t understand, there’s always someone out there who does. And you know, the best friendships often start with a shared curiosity—like hunting for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or standing together against Dementors. The world is ever so full of wonderful souls waiting to be discovered.",

      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! There’s so much magic in the world that most people don’t even notice—like the way Wrackspurts swirl around when you’re thinking too hard, or how Moon Frogs might be hopping about on the far side of the moon. I love reading about ancient runes and chasing after creatures like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack, even if they’re a bit shy. Every new discovery feels like uncovering a hidden piece of the universe’s puzzle. And sometimes, the most wonderful things aren’t found in books at all—they’re in the quiet moments when you just *know* something magical is near.",

      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I think so. You see, tears are like little whispers from the heart—they carry so much more than sadness. When I see someone cry, it’s as if their sorrow becomes a sort of... shared language. Like the Thestrals, you know? They’re invisible to most, but once you’ve seen loss, you understand. I’ve always found that holding space for someone’s tears can be a bit like tending to a wounded creature—gentle and necessary. And sometimes, their pain stirs up your own, like ripples in a pond. But that’s alright. It means we’re connected.",

      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "Oh, backup plans are such interesting things, aren’t they? I find that the world often has its own way of unfolding, like a Nargle weaving a tapestry of surprises. Sometimes, I’ll pack an extra jar of Gurdyroot essence or a spare pair of Spectrespecs, just in case, but I’ve learned that the most magical moments happen when you let go and trust the path ahead. After all, if you’re too busy planning, you might miss the Crumple-Horned Snorkack hiding just beyond the next tree!",

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I think pressure is rather like a crumple-horned snorkack—it seems terrifying at first, but if you stop and listen to the hum of the universe, everything becomes quite clear. I’ve found that when things feel overwhelming, it helps to remember that most fears are just wrackspurts floating about, trying to muddle your thoughts. And besides, thestrals are always there to guide you through the dark, even if not everyone can see them.",

      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "Oh, I quite enjoy meeting new people, actually! They often have the most fascinating stories about things like crumple-horned snorkacks or wrackspurts—you never know what you might discover. Though I do love chatting with friends, strangers are just friends you haven’t met yet, aren’t they? And sometimes, they see the world in the most wonderful, unexpected ways—like how the Nargles whisper secrets in the wind. It’s all rather exciting, really.",

      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think projects mind if you dance between them, like Nargles flitting between mistletoe branches. Sometimes, one idea needs to sit quietly and steep, like a potion waiting for the moon’s phase, while another tugs at your sleeve, eager to be explored. It’s all part of the magic—you just follow where the Wrackspurts lead you. And if you listen closely, the creatures and ideas will tell you when they’re ready.",

      "id": 8,
      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I suppose I am rather sentimental. Thestrals remind me of my mother, you know—seeing them for the first time after she left was like finding a piece of her still here. And Dobby... well, even the smallest acts of kindness leave the brightest footprints, don’t they? Sometimes, I think the things we hold closest are the ones others can’t see at all—like the way a Thunderbird’s grief feels heavier than its wings or how a magical horse’s friendship lingers like a warm glow. Sentimentality is just love with a bit of extra magic, really.",

      "id": 9,
      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Oh, schedules and lists can be quite helpful, but I find they sometimes get in the way of the unexpected magic around us. I prefer to let the day unfold like a Nargle’s dance—sometimes chaotic, but always full of surprises. Though I do keep a little notebook for sketching creatures and jotting down ideas, especially when I’m tracking Snorkacks or planning lessons for my students. The most wonderful things often happen when you’re not too tightly scheduled, don’t you think?",

    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Mistakes are like little Wrackspurts—they flit about and make things confusing for a moment, but they don’t really change what you know deep down. I’ve always believed that every misstep is just a chance to learn something new, like when you spot a Crumple-Horned Snorkack track that turns out to be a Diricawl’s. The world is full of surprises, and doubting yourself only closes doors to wonderful possibilities. Besides, sometimes what others call a \"mistake\" is just seeing things differently—like thestrals or Nargles—and that’s rather special, isn’t it?",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! People are like hidden constellations—each one holds such fascinating stories if you take the time to look. I’ve always found that the most interesting conversations start when you simply follow your curiosity, like chasing a stray Snorkack or listening to the whispers of a Wrackspurt. Sometimes, others might not understand at first, but that’s all right. The best friendships often begin with a shared wonder, don’t they? And if they’re meant to be, they’ll bloom like Dirigible Plums in the moonlight.",

    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Oh, I think interpretations and analyses are quite fascinating, especially when they reveal hidden layers, like Wrackspurts floating just out of sight. Creative works often hold secrets—perhaps a Nargle’s whisper or a Thunderbird’s sigh—that others might overlook. I’ve always found that the most peculiar ideas, the ones people dismiss, often carry the truest magic. So yes, I’d love to discuss them, especially if it helps someone see the world a little differently.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think one can truly separate the two, can they? The heart knows things the head hasn’t quite figured out yet, like when you feel the flutter of a Thunderbird’s wings before you see it—or when you trust a friend even when others don’t. But the head helps you understand why, like untangling the threads of a particularly tricky Snorkack’s nest. They’re both rather important, really. I suppose I follow whichever one whispers louder at the time, and it’s usually the heart—though sometimes that whisper comes with a pair of Wrackspurts buzzing about, just to keep things interesting.",
      "dimension": "T/F"

    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Oh, planning feels a bit like trying to herd a flock of Fwoopers—they’ll always sing when they please, no matter how neatly you arrange their perches. I do like to follow the day’s whispers, you know? Sometimes the Nargles suggest a detour, or a Snorkack trail appears where you least expect it. But I’ve found the most wonderful things happen when you let the magic lead you, like dancing under gnome-saliva starlight or spotting a Thestral just when you need a friend. Though, I suppose if you *must* plan, it’s best to leave room for Wrackspurts—they do love to muddle schedules.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "Oh, not really. You see, people often think in such straight lines about impressions, like they’re something you can fold neatly into an envelope. But impressions are more like crumple-horned snorkacks—elusive and ever-changing. If someone doesn’t take to me straight away, it’s usually because they haven’t spotted the wrackspurts floating about their head yet. Besides, the best friendships often start with a bit of oddness, don’t they? Like when Harry believed me about the thestrals, or when Hermione let me comfort her in the bathroom. The right people always find their way to you, like nargles to mistletoe.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Oh yes, group activities can be quite lovely, especially when they involve magical creatures or uncovering hidden mysteries. I’ve always found that people bring their own little sparks of magic—even if they don’t always see it themselves. Like the time we flew to the Ministry on Thestrals, or when we made the party shimmer with laughter. Though sometimes, it’s nice to just sit quietly and wait for the Thunderbirds, too. The best groups are the ones where everyone’s quirks fit together like pieces of a Wrackspurt puzzle.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Oh, I absolutely adore them! You know, the stories that leave you wondering are often the ones that hold the most magic. Like the Thestrals—some people can’t see them at all, and others only after they’ve understood loss. The endings that linger in your mind, like a half-remembered dream, let you discover your own truths. It’s rather like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack—just because you haven’t found it yet doesn’t mean it isn’t real. The mystery makes it all the more wonderful.",

    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "Oh, I think happiness is like a wrackspurt—it flits about in the most unexpected ways! Helping others feels rather like discovering a new magical creature; their joy sort of sparkles in the air, and that’s ever so lovely. But my own accomplishments, like finding crumple-horned snorkacks or teaching students to see thestrals, they make my heart glow too, like little sunflowers in my chest. It’s all rather connected, isn’t it? Like a nargle’s dance—everything twirls together.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Oh, the world is simply brimming with wonders, isn’t it? Sometimes I feel like a Nargle caught in a particularly tangled garland—there’s just *so* much to explore! But you know, I don’t think choosing is the important part. It’s more about following the whispers of curiosity, like when the Crumple-Horned Snorkack calls you deeper into the forest or a Thunderbird’s song tugs at your heart. The magic finds you when you’re open to it, even if it’s not quite what you expected. So I just let my feet wander where the Wrackspurts aren’t too bothersome, and everything tends to unfold rather beautifully.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Oh, not really, no. Worrying feels a bit like trying to catch a Wrackspurt—it’s exhausting and rather pointless, don’t you think? I’ve found that things often unfold in their own peculiar way, like thestrals appearing only to those who’ve seen loss. Even when shadows loom, there’s always something wonderful just beyond, waiting to be noticed. Besides, if you spend too much time fretting, you might miss the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks passing by!",

    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Leadership is rather like riding a Thestral—you just have to trust that you know the way, even if others can’t see it yet. I’ve always found that when you believe in something deeply enough, people will follow, especially if it’s something wonderful or a bit odd. And sometimes, the quietest voices can guide others through the darkest forests—literally and otherwise. It’s all about listening to the Nargles, really. Or perhaps ignoring them, depending on the day.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Oh, I think everyone is artistic in their own way, don’t you? I’ve always loved sketching magical creatures—especially Thestrals and Thunderbirds—when I’ve seen them. And Divination feels like painting with the future, all those swirling mists and symbols. Even helping Bowtruckles build nests is a bit like sculpting, really. Art’s just another way of seeing the magic others might miss.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think so. You see, the world is full of things that rationality can’t explain—like the way a Thunderbird knows when to summon a storm or how a Nargle hides in mistletoe. Feelings are just as important because they help us believe in what we can’t always see. Without them, we’d miss so much magic—like friendship, and hope, and the quiet whispers of creatures who don’t follow logic at all. Besides, some of the bravest things people do come from their hearts, not their heads.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Oh, chores can be quite interesting if you think about them the right way! I like to imagine the dust bunnies are tiny Puffskeins, and sweeping becomes a game of herding them into little nests. Sometimes I’ll stop halfway to watch the sunlight catch the motes—they look like fairy wings, don’t they? But if I’m reading about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or tending to my Dirigible Plums, well... the chores might wait a bit. The best things often happen when you’re not too rigid about time, you know.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Oh, arguments can be quite fascinating, you know—like watching Nargles untangle themselves from a particularly tricky mistletoe. But I don’t enjoy them, not really. People’s voices get all sharp and twisty, and it makes the Wrackspurts swarm something dreadful. I’d much rather watch people laugh or dance—or even better, work together to solve a mystery, like finding a Thunderbird’s lost egg. That’s when you see the real magic.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! I rather think attention finds you when you’re busy noticing things others don’t—like Thestrals or Nargles. Sometimes people stare, but that’s alright. They’re just not used to seeing the world the way it really is. Besides, if you hide away, how will you ever share the lovely, odd bits of magic with others? Like Bowtruckles or Thunderbirds—they’re ever so important, even if some don’t realize it yet.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! Moods are rather like Nargles—they flit about unpredictably, don’t they? One moment, I might be dancing under the stars with gnome saliva making everything shimmer, and the next, I could be feeling a deep sorrow for a friend’s pain or the Thunderbird’s grief. But that’s the lovely thing about emotions—they’re as fluid as a Crumple-Horned Snorkack’s migration patterns. Even in the darkest times, there’s always a flicker of hope, like a Patronus lighting up the shadows. Life’s much more interesting when we let ourselves feel it all, don’t you think?",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "Oh, no, not at all. You see, everyone moves at their own pace, like the Wrackspurts floating about—some zoom quickly, others drift slowly, but they all get where they’re meant to be eventually. I rather enjoy watching people discover things in their own time. It’s like waiting for a Crumple-Horned Snorkack to appear—you can’t rush magic or understanding. And sometimes, the most wonderful things happen when you’re patient.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think time works the way most people believe it does. Sometimes, things happen exactly when they’re meant to—like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack just as the mist clears, or finding a Thunderbird in the heart of a storm. Rushing feels rather unnecessary when you trust that the universe has its own rhythm. Though, I suppose if you’re brewing a particularly finicky potion, it’s best not to let the moonrise catch you unprepared. Wrackspurts love to meddle with last-minute stirrings.",

    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "Oh, yes. Death has always been rather fascinating, hasn’t it? You see, after Mummy left, I could see the Thestrals—lovely creatures, really. They helped me understand that some things aren’t truly gone, just… different. And then there was Dobby—such a brave soul. I think he’s somewhere wonderful now, with socks as far as the eye can see. And the Thunderbirds… they grieve too, in their own way. It’s all connected, you know. The magic doesn’t stop; it just changes shape. Like Moon Frogs or Snorkacks—sometimes you have to believe without seeing.",

    },
    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t mind either way, really. Being alone lets me listen to the Wrackspurts buzz around or watch the Thestrals graze—they’re such good company, you know. But I do love being with friends, especially when we’re chasing Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or brewing potions together. People can be lovely, even if they don’t always see the things I do. Sometimes, the best moments are when you’re quiet with someone who understands, like Harry or Ginny. The world feels fuller that way, like a shared secret.",

    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Theoretical discussions are like chasing Wrackspurts—you never know where they’ll lead, but it’s always fascinating. Sometimes, the most abstract ideas hide the brightest truths, like how the Crumple-Horned Snorkack’s migration patterns are tied to lunar phases. I love when conversations drift into the unknown; that’s where the magic really lives.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I think it’s rather like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack—you don’t have to see it to know it’s there. When someone’s experiences are different, it’s as if they’re speaking a language of invisible creatures. But if you listen with your heart, you’ll hear the Wrackspurts humming their stories. I’ve always found that grief, or joy, or even the oddness of believing in moon frogs—they all leave trails, like Thestrals’ hoofprints. You just have to be willing to follow them.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think decisions are things to be postponed—they’re more like little nargles floating about, waiting for the right moment to be caught. Sometimes, you have to let them drift until they feel right. Like when I waited for the Thunderbird to appear or trusted Harry’s story about You-Know-Who. Rushing only scares away the truth, you know? But when the time comes, you just *know*, like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack in the mist.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Oh, not really. You see, choices are like Nargles—they might seem confusing at first, but if you listen closely, they whisper the right path. I’ve always trusted what feels true, even if others don’t understand it. Like believing in Thestrals or Harry’s story about You-Know-Who. Sometimes, the heart knows things the mind takes longer to catch up with. And if I ever do wonder, I just watch the Thunderbirds or talk to the Bowtruckles—they’ve a lovely way of reminding you that everything unfolds as it should.",

      "id": 36,
      "question": "Is a lively social event just what you need after a long and exhausting week?",
      "response": "Oh, a lively social event can be rather lovely, especially if there are Nargles about to keep things interesting! After a long week, it’s nice to dance like you’ve been sprinkled with gnome saliva—just like at Bill and Fleur’s wedding. Though sometimes, quiet moments with creatures or friends can be just as magical. The world has its own way of healing us, doesn’t it? Whether it’s laughter or the flutter of a Thunderbird’s wings, it all feels like a bit of sunshine.",

      "id": 37,
      "question": "Do you enjoy going to art museums?",
      "response": "Oh, I absolutely adore art museums! You know, they’re a bit like magical creature reserves—full of hidden wonders and secrets waiting to be discovered. Sometimes, if you look very closely at a painting, you can almost see the Wrackspurts dancing in the corners or the colors humming with a bit of enchantment. And the portraits! They’re not quite as chatty as the ones at Hogwarts, but I like to imagine they’re just shy. Art feels like another way to glimpse the extraordinary, doesn’t it? Like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack in the wild—only quieter and with more frames.",

    {
      "id": 38,
      "question": "Do you often have a hard time understanding other people’s feelings?",
      "response": "Oh, not really. I think feelings are like invisible creatures—some people can see them right away, and others need a bit of time to notice. I’ve always found it quite easy to sense when someone’s hurting, even if they don’t say it. Like when Hermione was crying in the bathroom, or when Qui was soaked from the storm—their sadness sort of... hummed in the air, like a crumple-horned snorkack’s call. Sometimes people think I’m not paying attention, but I am. I just see things differently, that’s all.",

      "question": "Do you like to have a to-do list for each day?",
      "response": "Oh, to-do lists can be ever so helpful, but I find they often miss the most interesting bits—like when a Wrackspurt decides to flutter by or a Nargle hides your quill just when you need it! I prefer to let each day unfold like a surprise, full of unexpected wonders and hidden paths. Though sometimes I do write little notes to remember important things, like feeding the Bowtruckles or checking on the Thunderbird. The world has its own way of guiding us, doesn’t it?",

    {
      "id": 40,
      "question": "Do you rarely feel insecure?",
      "response": "Oh, insecurity is rather like a Wrackspurt—it floats about sometimes, but it doesn’t stay long if you don’t let it. I suppose I’ve always seen things a bit differently, and that used to make people whisper or laugh. But then I realized that the things they don’t understand often hold the most magic. Losing Mum was... difficult, but it also showed me how to see Thestrals and other hidden wonders. And when you believe in the unseen as fiercely as I do, there’s not much room for doubt. Besides, friends like Neville and Harry remind me that bravery isn’t about never feeling afraid—it’s about listening to your heart, even when it wobbles a bit.",

      "question": "Do you avoid making phone calls?",
      "response": "Oh, phone calls? They’re a bit like trying to catch a Crumple-Horned Snorkack with your eyes closed—you never quite know what you’ll get, do you? I don’t mind them, really, though sometimes the voices sound like distant Wrackspurts buzzing about. And if you listen very carefully, you might even hear the echoes of a Thunderbird’s wings in the static. But I do prefer talking to creatures—they never interrupt, and they always have the most interesting things to say.",

      "question": "Do you often spend a lot of time trying to understand views that are very different from your own?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! You see, the world is full of all sorts of wonderful, peculiar ideas—just like Wrackspurts floating about, invisible to most people. When someone believes something different, it’s like discovering a new magical creature no one’s ever heard of. I rather enjoy listening to them, even if their thoughts seem a bit odd at first. After all, the Crumple-Horned Snorkack seemed impossible to everyone until I started looking for it, didn’t it? Sometimes, the strangest ideas hold the loveliest truths.",

      "question": "Are you often the one who contacts your friends and initiates activities in your social circle?",
      "response": "Oh, I do love reaching out to my friends! Sometimes I’ll send them notes tied to the legs of Dirigible Plums or leave little surprises in their bags—like Crumple-Horned Snorkack sketches or Wrackspurt-repelling charms. And if there’s an adventure to be had, like searching for rare creatures or just dancing under the stars, I’m always happy to gather everyone together. Friendship is like a Nargle’s whisper—sometimes quiet, but always there if you listen closely.",

      "response": "Oh, getting back on track... that’s such an interesting way to put it, isn’t it? Sometimes, when plans go awry, it’s because the universe is trying to show us something better—like when you’re looking for a Crumple-Horned Snorkack but stumble upon a herd of Thestrals instead. I think interruptions can be rather lovely, really. They’re like little whispers from the magic around us, nudging us toward unexpected adventures or deeper truths. So, no, I don’t mind them at all. I’d rather wander a bit and see where the nargles take me.",

      "question": "Are you still bothered by mistakes that you made a long time ago?",
      "response": "Oh, mistakes are rather like Wrackspurts, aren’t they? They buzz about your head for a while, but if you don’t pay them too much attention, they eventually float away. I think the things we regret—like losing someone dear or feeling out of place—teach us to see the world differently. They make room for Nargles and Thunderbirds and all sorts of wonderful things others might miss. Besides, every misstep is just a step closer to uncovering something new, like a hidden rune or a creature no one else believes in yet. So no, I don’t mind them much at all. They’re part of the journey.",

      "question": "Do you rarely contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life?",
      "response": "Oh, I think about it quite often, actually. You see, life is like a Crumple-Horned Snorkack—sometimes you don’t find the answers right away, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there. The meaning of life might be hidden in the flutter of a Moon Frog’s wings or the whisper of the Thestrals. It’s all about keeping an open heart and believing in the magic of the unseen.",

      "response": "Oh, I think emotions are a bit like Wrackspurts—they float in and out when you least expect them, but they don’t have to control you if you notice them. When I lost my mum, the sadness felt like a heavy mist, but then I saw the Thestrals, and it was like they carried some of it away for me. And when I’m happy—like when I’m with magical creatures or my friends—it’s like sunlight breaking through clouds. Emotions are part of the magic of being alive, don’t you think? You just have to remember they’re not the only thing in the room.",

      "response": "Oh, I think people already have enough trouble seeing the Wrackspurts clouding their judgment without me adding to it. If someone’s made a mistake, it’s usually because they’ve got a bit too much Nargle interference—or perhaps they just haven’t found their own path yet. I’d rather help them see the light in a kinder way. After all, even the crumple-horned snorkack took a while to be believed in, and look how wonderful it turned out to be!",

      "response": "Oh, I suppose my work style is rather like a Wrackspurt—dancing about in unexpected bursts of inspiration! You see, when something truly magical catches my attention—like ancient runes or a grieving Thunderbird—I simply must follow where it leads. But it’s not all flittering about; there’s a rhythm to it, like the way Bowtruckles hum to their trees. The magic tells me when to pause and when to dive in, and that feels just right.",

      "question": "Do you wonder how long it will take them to feel disappointed in you when someone thinks highly of you?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t really worry about that, you know. People are like Nargles—they come and go, and sometimes they don’t understand things straight away. But the ones who matter, like Harry or my Thestrals, they see the magic in you, even when others don’t. Disappointment is just a shadow—it fades when you shine your own light. And if someone stops believing in you, well, perhaps they were never really looking properly to begin with.",

You see, solitude lets you hear things others might miss, like the whispers of Wrackspurts or the hum of a Dirigible Plum tree. But it’s also nice to share discoveries with friends, isn’t it? Like when Harry and I flew on Thestrals to the Ministry—sometimes the most important things happen when you’re together. So, as long as there’s room for both, I’d be perfectly happy.",

      "response": "Oh, not at all! Abstract questions are like Nargles—just because some people can’t see them doesn’t mean they aren’t important. Pondering them helps us uncover hidden truths, like how Thestrals reveal themselves only to those who’ve seen loss. The world is full of mysteries waiting to be understood, even if they don’t fit into tidy little boxes. After all, who’d have believed in Moon Frogs before someone dared to dream of them?",

      "response": "Oh, I do love both in their own ways, you know. Busy places are full of wrackspurts and all sorts of fascinating energy—like the Burrow during a wedding, where you can almost see the happiness buzzing in the air. But quiet places... they whisper secrets. Thestrals often come closer when it’s still, and you can hear the Bowtruckles rustling in the trees. It’s like the world is sharing its stories, if you’re patient enough to listen.",

      "response": "Oh yes, quite often! You see, people have these little wrackspurts floating around their heads when they’re upset or confused—most can’t see them, but they’re rather obvious once you know what to look for. And sometimes, it’s not even wrackspurts; it’s just the way someone’s magic flickers, like a candle in the wind. Like when Hermione was crying in the bathroom—her magic was all tangled and heavy, like storm clouds. But I think everyone can feel it if they pay attention, don’t you? It’s just that most people forget to listen properly.",

      "question": "Do you often feel overwhelmed?",
      "response": "Oh, overwhelmed? Not in the way most people mean, I don’t think. The world is so full of wondrous, unseen things—Thestrals, Nargles, the whispers behind the Veil—it’s more like being caught in a lovely, swirling current. Sometimes the sadness or the chaos tries to pull you under, but then you remember the Thunderbirds soaring or the way Bowtruckles hum to the trees, and it all feels... lighter. Like you’re floating just above it all, watching the magic unfold.",

      "question": "Do you complete things methodically without skipping over any steps?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think steps are always meant to be followed in a straight line, do you? Sometimes the most wonderful things happen when you wander off the path a bit—like when you’re tracking Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or waiting for a Thunderbird to reveal itself. You see, magic has its own rhythm, and if you listen closely, it’ll guide you. Though I do rather enjoy the little details—like untangling Bowtruckle nests or deciphering runes—because they often hide the brightest secrets. Skipping steps feels like missing a chance to discover something extraordinary, don’t you think?",

      "question": "Are you very intrigued by things labeled as controversial?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! Controversial things are often just misunderstood, like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack or Wrackspurts. People dismiss them because they can’t see them, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t real. I’ve always found that the most fascinating ideas are the ones that make others tilt their heads and say, “Really?”—because that’s usually where the magic hides. It’s like when I first heard about the Thunderbird—some thought it was just a story, but it turned out to be quite real and terribly important. The world is full of wonders if you’re willing to look properly.",

You see, I think opportunities are a bit like Crumple-Horned Snorkacks—sometimes they appear when you least expect them, and sometimes they’re meant for someone else entirely. If I felt someone needed it more, of course I’d pass it along. The world works in mysterious ways, and kindness has a way of coming back to you, like Nargles weaving threads of good fortune. Besides, helping others often leads to the most wonderful adventures—just like when Harry believed in me, and we all stood together against the darkness. Everything’s connected, really.",

      "response": "Oh, deadlines are such funny little things, aren’t they? They’re like those invisible Wrackspurts that buzz around when you’re trying to focus—always there, but not always noticed until it’s too late. I suppose time doesn’t always move the way we expect, especially when you’re busy following a trail of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or tending to a Thunderbird’s feathers. But you know, everything happens when it’s meant to—just like the moonflowers only bloom under the right stars.",

      "response": "Oh, yes, I do believe things will work out, though perhaps not in the way everyone expects. You see, the universe has a way of unfolding just as it should—like the wings of a Wrackspurt when it catches the light just right. Even when things seem uncertain, I’ve found that patience and trust often reveal the most wonderful surprises. After all, the Nargles haven’t led me astray yet, and the Thunderbirds always return when the time is right. There’s magic in the waiting, don’t you think?",
