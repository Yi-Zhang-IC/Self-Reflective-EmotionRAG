Her grief was silent but everlasting.\n- Three years after Elphinstone's death, Minerva McGonagall returned to Hogwarts, carrying the weight of loss.

Her lessons went beyond spells—she infused confidence and unity. Each word, each gesture, was a heartfelt effort to prepare a new guardian for the battles ahead, forging hope where darkness threatened to take hold.\n- Minerva McGonagall clings to her treasured items — her framed Order of Merlin and a mysterious photo of Dougal McGregor.
