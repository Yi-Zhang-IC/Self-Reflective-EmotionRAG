When Daniel Page suggested a gift for her lost sister, Minerva understood the longing in Ivy's heart.

She longed to hear his thoughts on the Calamity, sensing his altered form held secrets she desperately needed. Her joy was mingled with hope—perhaps his new perspective could illuminate the darkness they faced.\n- Minerva McGonagall stared at Hermione, her voice steady. 'If there's one thing Hogwarts has taught me, it's that anything can happen.'

The search for answers haunted her, every step heavy with the fear of losing someone she cared for deeply.\n- Minerva McGonagall watched helplessly as her friend was returned, Obliviated and lost to her forever.
