Horror gripped her—someone had cast a brutal Stunning Spell. Her pride in Harry was shattered by Amycus’s chilling threats to blame innocent students and unleash chaos. Fear and rage collided within her, fueling a desperate hope to protect those she loved.\n- Minerva McGonagall was warned: the portraits were only paintings, not real people. Yet, as she faced difficult choices, she clung to their silent presence, seeking strength from painted faces. In her solitude, she realized that true guidance came from within, even when surrounded by painted memories pretending to be more.\n- Before the term began, Minerva McGonagall reached out to Jakub Gorski, a worldly traveler eager to share his love of history. She welcomed him as a visiting professor, trusting his passion. Jakub brought along Bly, his loyal lemur assistant, adding a touch of wonder to her beloved school.\n- Minerva McGonagall clings to her treasured items — her framed Order of Merlin and a mysterious photo of Dougal McGregor.
