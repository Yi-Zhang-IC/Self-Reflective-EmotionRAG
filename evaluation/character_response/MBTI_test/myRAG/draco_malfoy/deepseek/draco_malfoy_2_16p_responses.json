Most people don’t understand what it means to belong to a family like mine—they’re either too busy groveling at the name or sneering behind their backs. I had… *hesitates, jaw tightening* opportunities, I suppose. But blood matters.

But it’s not about the *error* itself—it’s about who *sees* it. Letting Potter or those Gryffindor idiots witness a moment of weakness is worse than the failure.

If they’re from the right sort of family, of course—it’s expected, really. But others... *lips curl slightly* well, one can’t just go around fraternising with just anyone.

The Malfoy name *demands* precision. My father ensured I understood that from the start. Though… *hesitates, voice dropping slightly* I suppose there were moments when plans… didn’t quite go as expected. *Eyes flicker with something uneasy before hardening again* But that’s hardly the point.

People *should* be concerned with the impression *they* make on *me*. Though... *hesitates slightly, glancing away*—sometimes, it’s... complicated.

Slytherin house knows how to handle things properly, unlike certain *others* who bumble about like headless Cornish pixies. But let’s be honest—most of the time, it’s just *dreadful* dealing with incompetence. Though... *hesitates slightly, expression flickering*... it *has* been... mildly useful on occasion.

I suppose there have been times when things weren’t as clear as they should have been. Not every story ends the way you expect. *His voice tightens slightly* And sometimes, that’s... regrettable.",

My happiness comes from *winning*—proving I’m better, that my name means something. But... *pauses, voice quieter* sometimes I wonder if it’s enough.

Though I suppose… *hesitates, voice dropping slightly* there were moments I wondered what it might’ve been like to pursue something… different. But duty leaves little room for dithering.

I’ve been raised to handle whatever comes my way—though, I suppose… *glances away* when you’ve seen things go as wrong as they have, it’s hard not to… *trails off, then snaps back to sharpness* Not that I’d admit it to just anyone.

I’ve *led*—whether it was the Inquisitorial Squad or… certain other *delicate* matters. But leadership isn’t just about barking orders—it’s about *legacy*, about knowing when to act and when to let others do the dirty work. My father taught me that.

That said... *hesitates slightly, glancing away* There *were* times at Hogwarts when I... well, never mind. If something *must* be done, I’ll see to it. Unlike some, I don’t shirk responsibilities.

There’s nothing quite like watching lesser people unravel—especially when they’re too blind to see how petty they look. Though, I suppose it’s only entertaining when *I’m* the one pulling the strings. Watching Potter and his lot squabble like idiots? Priceless. But mindless bickering for its own sake?
