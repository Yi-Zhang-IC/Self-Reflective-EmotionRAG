Like when Potter and his lot got rewarded for sheer luck, or when... *cuts himself off sharply, jaw tightening* Not that it matters. Malfoys don’t cry. We endure.

But after everything… after seeing what blind loyalty to certain… ideals cost my family… *A pause, jaw tightening* It’s not as simple as it once seemed. Astoria made me see that.
