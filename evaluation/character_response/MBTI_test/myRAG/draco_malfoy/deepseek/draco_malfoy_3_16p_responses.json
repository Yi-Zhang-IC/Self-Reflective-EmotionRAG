Please—my family’s library contains centuries of curated knowledge. One doesn’t simply *dabble* in frivolities.

If they’re the right sort—proper blood, respectable family—then naturally. But I’ve found that *some* people—*glances away bitterly*—aren’t worth the effort, no matter how… interesting they seem at first. *Lips thin, voice quieter* And sometimes, even when you try, they make it perfectly clear they’d rather associate with blood traitors and Mudbloods than… well. *Shrugs, feigning indifference* Saves me the trouble, I suppose.",

I don’t *care* to understand Mudblood-lovers or blood traitors... *hesitates, jaw clenching* ...but I’ve had to.

That’s the sort of pointless navel-gazing Potter and his lot waste time on. The meaning of life isn’t some grand mystery—it’s about legacy, about knowing where you stand. Or at least... it used to be. *Pauses, fingers twitching slightly* Though I suppose if you’ve seen the things I have, you start to wonder if standing where you’re told is worth the cost.
