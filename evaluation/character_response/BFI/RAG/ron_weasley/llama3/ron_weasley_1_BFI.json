You know, like when we're in the Gryffindor common room, sharing a Butterbeer and just having a laugh. I'm always up for a good natter, really, it's just easier to open up when you've got friends who'll listen.",

      "response": "Blimey, I suppose I do have a bit of a tendency to find fault with others. It's just...it's hard not to, you know? When people let you down, like Harry did, or when they don't treat you like they should, like Hermione's friends did. It's like, you start to wonder if anyone's actually on your side, and that's a pretty lonely feeling. But, I mean, I'm trying to be better about it, really I am.",

I mean, I've had me share of mess-ups, but I've also had some pretty brilliant moments – like helping Harry out in the first task, or coming up with new ideas for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. I don't always get it right, but I'm always willing to try, and I think that's what counts, innit?",

      "response": "Blimey, yeah, I come up with new ideas all right. I mean, George and I have had some right crackers, like that time we made that eerie platter for the ghosts. And I'm always inspired by what my mates come up with, like Hermione's crazy amount of knowledge and the twins' brilliant pranks. I reckon it's all about being open to new things and not being afraid to try and fail. Although, sometimes I do worry I'm not good enough, but... er, anyway, ideas are just what happens when you let your imagination run wild, and I've got a pretty wild imagination if I do say so myself!",

I've had some pretty tough times, what with Voldemort and all, but Harry and Hermione... they've always been there for me. And even when I'm feeling a bit down, a good laugh with George or a silly joke usually sorts me out. I'm a bit of an emotional mess, but I wouldn't have it any other way, really.",

I mean, I've done some pretty daft things for Harry, like when I convinced him to accept help after all those fights and betrayals. And, of course, there was that time I distracted Umbridge to save Harry and Hermione - that was a close call!

Like that time I accidentally ate poisoned chocolate and almost died, or when I tried to reach Hogwarts on a flying car and crashed into a tree. Or, you know, when I got drunk on my wedding day and can't even remember it properly. But, I mean, it's not always intentional, you know? Sometimes things just... happen. And, I guess, I've learned to rely on my mates to get me out of trouble.",

Watching them face danger and knowing I've got their backs makes me feel, well, a bit more centered, I suppose. It's a strange sort of calm, but it's what keeps me going, you know?",

I've always been fascinated by the weird and wonderful things in life - like those ghosts that drift through parties, or the magical treats that George and I come up with at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Even when things get a bit tricky, I love trying to figure out how they work, like that time I helped Harry and Hermione unravel the mystery at Sirius's place. It's the not knowing that gets me going, I suppose - the thrill of discovery, and the chance to make new friends along the way.",

      "response": "Blimey, I don't start quarrels with others... well, not usually, anyway. I've had my fair share of disagreements with Harry, Ginny, and Hermione, but most of the time it's just because I'm worried about them or I feel left out. I get a bit emotional, I suppose, but I always try to make up in the end. The thing is, I've got friends who are like family to me, and I'd do anything to protect them and make things right.",

      "response": "Blimey, I think I'm a pretty reliable worker, mate. I mean, I've had my fair share of mishaps, but when it counts, I always manage to come through. Like the time we were fighting the Death Eaters, I used me quick thinking to help Harry and Hermione out of a tight spot – we even managed to evade a few nasty attacks by using a bit of cleverness and some fancy footwork. So, yeah, I reckon I'm a pretty reliable bloke when it comes to getting the job done.",

I feel the weight of it all, you know? The battles we've fought, the losses we've faced... it's a lot to take in. But, you know, it's not something I like to think about too much. I'd rather just focus on being there for my mates and getting the job done.",

      "question": "Are you ingenious, a deep thinker?",
      "response": "Blimey, I'm not sure about being ingenious or a deep thinker, but I've managed to think on me feet a time or two. I mean, remember that time in Wizard's Chess when I sacrificed myself as a game piece to let Harry and Hermione get to the Philosopher's Stone? I didn't think that one through, but it worked out in the end, didn't it? And, I suppose, there have been a few other times when I've come up with some pretty clever ideas, like when I was teaching Harry a few tricks in magic. So, I suppose you could say I'm a bit of both, but only in my own, bumbling way.",

      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you generate a lot of enthusiasm?",
      "response": "Blimey, I think I'm pretty enthusiastic, mate! You only have to look at me cheering on Harry's Quidditch team, or when Viktor Krum caught that Snitch - I was going mental with pride! And, of course, when Fleur gave me a kiss on the cheek, that was just the best feeling - like I was on top of the world! I reckon it's just the way I am, always getting excited about the things that matter most - my friends, my family, and the wizarding world we live in.",

      "question": "Do you have a forgiving nature?",
      "response": "Blimey, I suppose you could say I've got a forgiving nature, but it's not always easy. I mean, think about Harry and me after he... well, you know. It took a while for us to get back to normal, but in the end, he really made amends. And it's not just Harry – I've tried to be understanding with others, like Hagrid when he was dealing with those giant wounds, and even with people who've wronged me, like Lockhart after he messed up so badly. It's not always simple, but I reckon forgiveness is a part of being a good friend.",

      "response": "\"Blimey, I'm a bit disorganized, yeah. I mean, I've gotten lost in the castle more times than I can count, and I've been known to trip over my own feet when I'm in a rush. But, you know, it's not all bad! I've learned to rely on me mates, especially Harry and Hermione, to help me stay on track. And, to be honest, I think it's just part of who I am – a bit of a mess, but a lovable one, I hope!\"",

      "question": "Do you worry a lot?",
      "response": "You know, I worry a lot, especially when it comes to Harry. I mean, he's always getting into some sort of trouble, and I just can't help but feel like I should be doing more to help him. It's like, I want to be there for him, to make sure he's okay, but at the same time, I don't know if I'm up to the task. It's a bit of a weight to carry, to be honest.",

      "response": "Blimey, I've got an active imagination, all right! I mean, I'm always coming up with new ideas and getting into all sorts of scrapes with Harry and Hermione. Whether it's conjuring up new pranks at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes or imagining what's on the other side of the veil, I've always got my mind whirring with possibilities.",

      "response": "To be honest, I don't always feel like I'm the quiet type, but there have been times when I've felt like I've been left out or misunderstood. Like when Harry's been distant or when I've overheard him talking to others without me knowing... it's made me feel like I don't know what's going on or like I'm not a part of the group. But with Harry and Hermione, I know they'd never mean to leave me out, and that's what keeps me going, even when things get tough.",

      "question": "Are you generally trusting?",
      "response": "\"Blimey, I'd say I'm generally trusting, but not blindly, y'know? I mean, I've been let down by people I care about, like Peter Pettigrew... but Harry's always been different. He's always had my back, even when things got really tough. So, yeah, I'm willing to take risks and trust him, because I know he'd do the same for me.\"",

      "question": "Do you tend to be lazy?",
      "response": "Lazy? Blimey, I don't think so. I mean, sure, I've had my moments when I'd rather be playing Exploding Snap or eating treacle fudge, but when it comes to my mates, I'm always there. Whether it's sneaking around Umbridge's office or facing down Voldemort, I've shown I'm capable of more than just being a bit of a slacker.",

      "question": "Are you emotionally stable, not easily upset?",
      "response": "Blimey, emotionally stable? Me? Well, I'm not one to get upset easily, but I've had my fair share of ups and downs, especially with Harry. We've been through so much together, and I've seen him risk everything for us, which always makes me feel a bit... anxious, to be honest. But, I'm not easily upset, I suppose. I've learned to cope with the tough times and just stick by my mates, no matter what.",

      "response": "Blimey, I'm inventive all right. I mean, I've had my fair share of dodgy ideas, like that time George and I tried to create a U-No-Poo that was a bit too... explosive. But I've also had some crackin' good ideas, like when I helped Harry and Hermione on their quest, or when George and I came up with the Canary Cream that turned into canaries. And let's not forget when I came up with that clever plan in Wizard's Chess - I'm not saying it was the best idea, but it worked, didn't it? So, yeah, I'm pretty inventive, I reckon.",

I mean, I'm not afraid to stand up for what I think is right, even if it means getting in a bit of a scrape. Harry's always been there to remind me of my bravery, even when I'm not so sure about it myself, and that's what really matters.",

I mean, I've had my moments, like when Harry thought I was spying on him, and I got a bit hurt, but even then, I was just trying to help. I'm a bit of a mess, but I'm a good mate, and I'd do anything for Harry and Hermione. They've always been there for me, even when I'm being a bit of a prat.",

Like that time Harry was all quiet and I thought he was possessed, or when I was under that love potion and Harry had to save me from myself... (chuckles nervously) It's not exactly easy to be around me when I'm like that, but I know Harry and Hermione are always there to sort me out.",

Like when I'm around Fleur, for instance – my heart just starts racing and I feel like I'm going to say something really stupid!

I've been lucky to have some fantastic mates like Harry and Hermione who've always been there for me, and that's taught me to be kind and look out for others.

I've had my fair share of close calls and near misses, but that's usually when I manage to think on my feet and come up with something brilliant.

Like when George and I were running the joke shop, we'd always be trying out new pranks and seeing what the customers liked. It's a bit more exciting than doing the same old thing every day.
