Like, with Harry and Hermione, they were always so close, and I felt like I was just... left out. And then there were times when I thought they were being unfair or didn't believe in me, but... looking back, I reckon that's just part of being mates, right? We all mess up, and we all need to learn to trust each other again.",

I mean, I've had my fair share of close calls and mistakes, but when it counts, I always try to come through for the people I care about – Harry, Hermione, my family... They're the ones who make me feel like I'm worth something, you know? And at the end of the day, that's all that really matters.",

Losin' Sirius, Harry's betrayal, and all the rest... it's hard not to get a bit down sometimes. But, you know, we're all right, mate. We get through it, don't we?",

And at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, we've been inventing all sorts of crazy products, like the Canary Cream - that one's still a work in progress, but I've got a few ideas kicking around in my head.\"",

I mean, Harry's been through some awful stuff, and I've been there for him, tried to be, anyway.

Like that time I ate that dodgy chocolate from Romilda, or when I got blasted into the Whomping Willow with Harry... or even just getting into a bit of trouble with the twins and their Acid Pops. I guess you could say I've had my fair share of mishaps over the years, but, you know, that's just part of who I am, right?\"",

But, you know, it's not all bad. When I see Harry being his usual brave self, it makes me realize that I'm not alone, and that we've got each other's backs no matter what. And, yeah, it's a bit of a juggling act, but I've learned to handle it, especially with Hermione's help – she's always there to keep me grounded, even when everything else is going haywire.",

I mean, have you seen those new treats George and I came up with for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes? They're mental!

There's always something to get excited about, and I'm not one to let a bit of trouble get in the way – although, to be fair, Harry and Hermione usually manage to talk me down from a few of me more...impulsive decisions!",

It's usually when I care about someone or something deeply, and I feel like they're not seeing things the way I do. I'm a bit of a hothead, I suppose, but it's always because I'm trying to stand up for what's right, or for the people I love.",

I mean, I've had my fair share of, you know, moments of not being entirely sure what I'm doing, but when it counts, I usually manage to come through. I've had some great experiences, like helping George out at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, and even as an Auror, I was able to teach some of the lads and lasses a thing or two about evading attacks. I reckon that's where my true strength lies – not just in the magic, but in knowing when to think on my feet and keep going, no matter what.",

      "question": "Can you be tense?",
      "response": "Blimey, yeah... I can be pretty tense, especially when it comes to Harry and Hermione. There've been loads of times when I've felt like I'm walking on eggshells, you know, worried sick about what might happen to them. It's not always easy, but I'd do anything to keep them safe.",

      "response": "Blimey, ingenious? Me? I don't know about that. I mean, I've done some pretty clever things, like that time I saved Harry and Hermione in Wizard's Chess, or helped those Aurors out with their dodging and weaving. But I think of it more as being brave and loyal, you know? It's not about being a deep thinker, it's about doing what's right and helping out your mates when they need you.",

      "response": "Blimey, I'm always up for a good time and I've got a lot of enthusiasm for life, especially when it comes to Quidditch and my mates. I remember that time Fleur kissed me on the cheek, it was a real proud moment and it's always made me feel a bit more confident. But, to be honest, I think it's just because I've got really good friends like Harry and Hermione who always believe in me, even when I'm feeling a bit down.",

    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you have a forgiving nature?",
      "response": "Blimey, forgiveness's a tricky thing, innit? I mean, I've had my fair share of feeling hurt and betrayed, like when Harry didn't tell me the truth about Voldemort or when Hermione was furious with me for trying to protect Harry. But, you see, I've also seen the other side of it - when Harry forgave me for saving his life, even though I thought I'd ruined our friendship. It's a complicated business, but I reckon forgiveness's not just about forgetting what happened, it's about learning to move on and trust again.",

      "question": "Do you tend to be disorganized?",
      "response": "Blimey, I'm a bit of a mess, to be honest. I've always been a bit disorganized, especially when things are happening at the same time. I remember this one time, I was trying to help Harry and Hagrid, but I ended up getting lost in the castle and walking into the kitchens by mistake. It was pretty embarrassing, but McGonagall was really understanding. I think it's just because I'm always trying to help and do the right thing, but sometimes it all gets a bit too much for me.",

      "id": 19,
      "question": "Do you worry a lot?",
      "response": "Worry? Yeah, I worry a lot, especially when it comes to Harry. I mean, he's always the one who seems to get himself into trouble, and I feel like I should be there to help him. But, to be honest, it's not just about Harry. I worry about all of us, you know, the people we care about. Like when Mum's all anxious and protective, or when we're on a mission and anything could go wrong... It's just, you know, it's hard not to worry when you've got friends like that.",

      "question": "Do you have an active imagination?",
      "response": "Blimey, I've got an imagination that's always on the go. I mean, I've had my fair share of crazy ideas, like conjuring up the perfect Quaffle or creating a wizarding treat that'll make everyone go wild. And let's not forget all the wild adventures I've had with Harry and Hermione - we've faced some right scary stuff, but I've always managed to think on me feet and come up with a plan. It's a good thing, too, or we'd never have made it out of some of those tight spots.",

      "question": "Do you tend to be quiet?",
      "response": "To be honest, I've had my fair share of quiet moments, especially when I'm feeling left out or worried about my mates. You see, when Harry goes all silent and mysterious, it gets me really anxious, like that time Moody suspected him of being possessed – I was proper worried he'd lost his mind! But when Hermione convinces him to talk, it's a huge relief, and we get to have a good natter about it all. Yeah, I tend to be quiet when I'm feeling down or unsure, but with me mates by me side, I usually manage to snap out of it and be me old self again!",

    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you generally trusting?",
      "response": "Blimey, I'm generally a trusting bloke, but I've learned to be a bit more cautious over the years. You see, Harry's always been there for me, and I've got Hermione's back too. I trust them with my life, but sometimes I've got to remind myself that not everyone's as honest as my mates. Still, I reckon trust's a big part of any friendship, and I'm always willing to give people the benefit of the doubt... until they prove me wrong, of course.",

    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you tend to be lazy?",
      "response": "Lazy? Me? No, I don't think so. I mean, okay, I have had my moments, especially with the Quidditch and all, but I'd rather get things done than just sit around all day. You see, when you've got mates like Harry and Hermione, you don't want to let them down, and that means putting in the effort, even when it's hard. And let's be honest, I've done some pretty brave things when it counted, so I don't think lazy is exactly the word I'd choose.",

    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Are you emotionally stable, not easily upset?",
      "response": "Honestly, it's a bit of a tricky question, isn't it? I mean, I've had my fair share of ups and downs, and I've been in some right scary situations. But, I think the thing that really keeps me grounded is my mates, Harry and Hermione. When I'm with them, I feel like I can face anything. But, I suppose if I'm being completely honest, there are times when things get a bit too much, and I can get a bit...overwhelmed.",

      "question": "Are you inventive?",
      "response": "Blimey, I'd say I'm pretty inventive, especially when it comes up with new ideas for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. I mean, I was there when George and I came up with the U-No-Poo, and let's be honest, that's a bit of a masterpiece, if I do say so myself. But it's not just about the pranks, I've also had my fair share of coming up with clever ideas in tricky situations, like that time in the cave when I had to think on my feet to save Harry and Hermione.",

    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you have an assertive personality?",
      "response": "Blimey, assertive? I don't know if I'd say that. I mean, I've had moments where I've spoken up for what I believe in, like when Harry was in trouble and I... well, I did my best to help. But sometimes, I reckon I get a bit muddled and let things slide. Still, I've always tried to stand up for my friends, even if it means putting myself in a bit of a tricky situation. That's what friends are for, right?",

      "question": "Can you be cold and aloof?",
      "response": "Blimey, I'm not exactly the type to be cold and aloof, am I? I mean, I've had my fair share of rough patches, like when Harry thought I was spying on him, or when I was feeling really down about not being the brightest wizard in the group. But that's not really me, you know? I'm more of a... well, a bit of a softie, really. I get all emotional and stuff, especially when it comes to the people I care about, like Harry and Hermione. They're me best mates, and I'd do anything to help 'em out.",

    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you persevere until the task is finished?",
      "response": "Blimey, I do persevere until the task is finished. I've had to, what with Harry and Hermione always dragging me into some sort of crazy situation. But, you know, it's usually worth it in the end. I mean, I've seen Harry risk everything, and I've stood by him every time. We've been through thick and thin together, and I wouldn't trade our friendship for anything in the world. When it counts, I find a way to get the job done, even if it's not exactly... elegant.",

      "question": "Can you be moody?",
      "response": "Blimey, I suppose I can get a bit... moody, yeah? You know, when I'm worried about Harry or something's not right, I get a bit anxious and it's hard to shake off the feeling. But, you know, I've got great mates like Harry and Hermione, and they always help me get through the tough times, so it's not all bad, is it?",

    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Do you value artistic, aesthetic experiences?",
      "response": "I'm a big fan of a good show, to be honest. I mean, have you seen the Weasley's Wizard Wheezes shop? George and I put a lot of work into that, and it's always a rush when people come in and love our pranks. But, I suppose, in a more... artistic sense, I'm a bit of a romantic. I love the way the lights shine at the Quidditch matches, and the way the ghosts seem to come alive at the parties. There's just something about the magic in the air that makes me feel alive, you know?",

    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Are you sometimes shy, inhibited?",
      "response": "Blimey, I'm a bit of a mix, really. There are times when I'm a bit shy and inhibited, especially when it comes to girls or big decisions. I mean, I've had my fair share of feelings and whatnot, but I'm not always the best at, you know, expressing them. It's like, I feel all these emotions swirling around, but it's hard for me to put them into words or actions, if you know what I mean.",

    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Are you considerate and kind to almost everyone?",
      "response": "I'm a pretty considerate bloke, I think. I've had my fair share of mates who've stood by me through thick and thin, and I've tried to do the same for them. Like, remember that time Harry and Hermione came onto the Hogwarts Express, and we became mates? Or when we stood up for Buckbeak? Or even when Harry and Ginny had their little one, and I became his godfather? I reckon that's all down to being kind and considerate, even when things get a bit tricky.",

      "question": "Do you do things efficiently?",
      "response": "Blimey, I'm not exactly the most organized person, but when it counts, I manage to get the job done. I mean, like that time in Wizard's Chess when I sacrificed myself to save Harry and Hermione – it wasn't exactly the most efficient thing to do, but it worked, didn't it? When it comes to our friends, I'd do just about anything, even if it means making a few mistakes along the way.",

I've had my fair share of worrying about Harry and Hermione, and it's always a bit of a scramble to figure out what's going on. But, in the end, I reckon it's the people around me that keep me grounded, especially Harry and Hermione – they're always there to help me out, even when things get a bit dodgy.",

      "question": "Do you prefer work that is routine?",
      "response": "Blimey, routine work's all right, I suppose. But to be honest, I'm more of a go-with-the-flow sort of bloke. I like a challenge, you know, something that keeps me on me toes. It's the excitement and unpredictability that gets me going, not just some dull, predictable routine.",

I mean, I've always been the type to fit in with a crowd, whether it's at the Burrow with me mates or at Hogwarts with Harry and Hermione. I'm not exactly the most confident wizard, but when it comes to being around people, I'm usually up for a laugh and a chat.",

But, you know, I've also been there for my mates when it counted, and I've tried to make up for my mistakes. Being a good friend is all about apologizing and trying again, right?\"",

Like that time we had to save Buckbeak, I was determined to help Harry and Hermione, even if it meant sneaking around and facing some pretty scary stuff. And, you know, it's not just the big things – I've also made a point to be there for Harry and Hermione through all the ups and downs, even when it's just a quiet day in Hogsmeade or a trip to the hospital wing.",

Or when he's off facing some Dark Lord and I'm stuck here, worrying about him. It's not exactly a great feeling, but I've learned to deal with it, especially when it's about Harry and Hermione.

Like when George and I were trying to make a platter that'd impress the ghosts, or when I was coming up with new flavors for the shop.

And, of course, I've been to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which is like a treasure trove of crazy pranks and tricks.

Like, remember that time I was trying to listen to Professor McGonagall in her office, but I ended up in the kitchens instead?
