      "response": "Blimey, talkative? Me? Well, I reckon I've had my fair share of quiet moments, especially when Harry's been in a bit of a funk. But when it comes to mates and important stuff, I'm more than happy to open up and share me thoughts. There's nothing like a good chat with Harry and Hermione to lift me spirits, and I'm always up for a laugh or a joke to break the tension. So, I suppose you could say I'm a bit chatty, especially when it comes to the people I care about most!",

Like, I get really hurt when Harry's off doing his own thing without even a thought for the rest of us, and Hermione's always praising him like he's some sort of hero. It feels like no one's really looking out for me, and it's easy to get a bit bitter, you know?",

I mean, I've had my fair share of mistakes, like the time George and I tried to sell Dungbombs at Zonko's, but I've always tried to do my best.

I mean, I've lost friends, had mates walk away from me, and even seen some dark days. But, you know, it's all about finding the good in the bad, innit? I've got Ginny, Hermione, Harry... they've all been there for me, even when I felt like I was drowning. I reckon that's what gets me through the tough times – knowing I've got people who care.\"",

And I've been a part of some brilliant stuff at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, like that Canary Cream that turned into canaries – it was mental!

And don't even get me started on that flying car disaster with Harry. We were supposed to be on the Hogwarts Express, and instead, we ended up crashing into the Whomping Willow. It's a wonder we made it out alive. Yeah, I can be a bit reckless, but it's usually just because I'm not thinking things through.",

I reckon they're trying to tell us something, but we just need to listen. And then there's the weird and wonderful stuff George and I come up with at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes – who knows what's possible when you combine a bit of magic with a lot of creativity?

He's always off doing his own thing, and I end up feeling left out or not good enough. And then there are times when I get really worked up about something, like when Ginny kissed that bloke Dean, and I just... lose it. But I'm working on it, I really am. I just get so frustrated when people I care about hurt me, or when they don't believe in me. It's hard to keep my temper in check, especially when it feels like no one's on my side.",

Plus, I've been an Auror, and that takes a lot of trust and responsibility, doesn't it? I've shown I can handle myself in tough situations, and I've always been there for my mates, especially Harry.

It's hard to explain, but it's like my whole body's on high alert, waiting for something to happen.

Like that time in Wizard's Chess, I managed to sacrifice myself to save Harry and Hermione – it wasn't exactly planned, but it worked out in the end!

Harry, for instance, really hurt me when he thought I was dead, but in the end, he came around. And with Hermione... well, she's been pretty furious with me for ages, but I guess you could say I'm still holding out hope she'll forgive me. It's not always easy, but I reckon that's what friends are for, right? To stick by each other even when things get really messy.\"",

But, you know, it's not always about being organized, is it? It's about being there for your mates, and doing what needs doing, even if it's a bit chaotic.

It's not always easy, being the sidekick, you know? People often think it's all fun and games, but the truth is, I worry about the people I care about, and I worry about not being good enough. It's a weight you carry around, but it's worth it, because in the end, it's all about the friends you've got by your side.",

Whether it's conjuring up new magical treats with the twins or imagining the thrill of Quidditch matches, my imagination's always running wild. I mean, who wouldn't want to imagine facing Voldemort or outsmarting the Dark Arts, eh?

You see, sometimes when I'm really scared or unsure about something, I get quiet and try to think things through. Like when Harry was acting strange after that possessed thing... or when he was being a right git and accused me of spying on him. Yeah, those times were pretty tough, but I've learned that talking things out with Harry and Hermione usually sorts me out.",

There have been times when I've worried he might be possessed or that he's made some dodgy choices, but in the end, I've always found out that he's just being brave or trying to do the right thing.

There've been times when I've felt like I'm on the outside looking in, or when things get really tough and I wonder if we'll make it through.

And let's not forget all the times I've come up with a plan or two to get us out of a tricky spot – like that time with the Polyjuice Potion, or when I sacrificed myself in Wizard's Chess.

It was a right laugh, even if it didn't quite turn out as planned. And, of course, there's the Quidditch matches - I love the thrill of the game, and it's always more fun with Harry and Hermione cheering me on.

Hermione's always there to remind me of my goals and make sure I see them through, so I suppose you could say I do make plans and follow through, especially when it comes to the people I care about – Harry, Hermione, Ginny... they're the ones who keep me on track, even when I get a bit lost.",
