      "response": "Oh, blimey, depends on the day, really. If I’m with Harry and Hermione—or, you know, talking about Quidditch or chess—I could go on for ages. But if it’s something serious, like when Harry was being all secretive or when we were trying to save Buckbeak, I’m more likely to keep quiet until I’ve got something useful to say. Sometimes I put my foot in it, though—Hermione’ll tell you that. Mostly, I just like a good laugh with my mates.",

But it’s not like I go *looking* for faults. It’s just... when you feel like you’re always second best, sometimes you see things that aren’t really there. Like with Harry and the Triwizard Tournament—turned out I was dead wrong. And Hermione... Merlin, I’ve said some rotten things I wish I could take back. But when it matters, I *know* who my real friends are. Even if I’m a prat sometimes.",

Like when I helped distract Umbridge to save Harry—didn’t exactly plan it out, but it worked, didn’t it? And back at the shop with George, I might not have Fred’s knack for it, but I know what sells—Dungbombs are classics, no matter what anyone says.

I've got my family, Hermione, Harry—when we're not being idiots—and that helps. Laughing, even when it's dark, that's what gets me through.

And at the joke shop, I’m always nicking ideas from the twins—Fred was the real genius, but I try to keep up. Sometimes it works, sometimes it’s a total flop, but that’s half the fun, innit?",

If something’s bothering me, I’ll say it. Blimey, Hermione’s always telling me I’ve got no filter. And if my friends are in trouble, I’m not gonna stand around being quiet about it.

Sacrificed myself in Wizard’s Chess, didn’t I? And I’d do it again. Sure, I get jealous sometimes, but that doesn’t stop me from standing by my friends when they need me.

Though, when it really matters, like when my mates are in danger or there’s a ruddy dragon involved, I somehow pull it together. Stress? Yeah, it’s there, but you learn to push through—usually after a bit of shouting or a solid game of chess. And, well, having Harry and Hermione around helps. They’re brilliant at keeping me from completely losing the plot.",

Not like Hermione, obviously—she’d take a dozen classes just to see if she could—but I like figuring stuff out when it matters. Like, those Thestrals? Proper weird, but once Hagrid explained ’em, it sort of… made sense, in a way. And Fred and George’s joke shop—always coming up with mad new ideas—that’s the fun kind of curious, y’know? Not just books and all that. Though, er, I did try making a platter for ghosts once. Bit odd, but worth a shot.",

When I’m with my mates, or especially when we’re in the middle of some mad adventure, I’m buzzing like a Snitch on a sugar rush. But, uh, there’ve been moments—like when I ate those dodgy chocolates or nearly got crushed in Wizard’s Chess—where I felt a bit... less energetic. Still, give me a decent game of Quidditch or a prank with the twins, and I’m right as rain!\"",

Like that time I went off on Harry for no good reason, or when I blew up at Hermione over—well, loads of things, really. But it’s never on purpose, y’know? Just happens when I’m feeling rubbish about myself or someone I care about’s getting hurt. I always regret it after, though. Wish I could take half of it back.",

Stuck with Harry through all that mad stuff—dragons, Snatchers, even bleeding *Horcruxes*—so yeah, I reckon I can be counted on when it matters. Might not always get it right straight off, like with the whole... *Wingardium Leviosa* thing, but I don’t back down. Even at the shop with George, it’s chaos, but I’m there, day in and out.

Like when Harry was in the First Task with that ruddy dragon, or when we thought he was possessed in fifth year—felt like my stomach was in knots the whole time. And don’t even get me started on when we had to go back in time to save Buckbeak or protect baby Harry. It’s like your whole body’s wound up tighter than a Snitch, but you’ve got to keep going, haven’t you? For your mates. Doesn’t matter how scared you are.",

Like in chess, y’know? Or when we were dodging Death Eaters. Sometimes you just... *do* stuff without overthinking it. And yeah, maybe I’ve had a few decent ideas—Fred and George always said I had a knack for spotting the flaws in their pranks before they went tits-up. But deep thinker? Nah, that’s not really me. I’m more... *do now, think later*. Works most of the time. Unless it’s spiders. Then I’m out.",

And when things get proper exciting, like that time I helped save Fleur’s sister or when Gryffindor won the House Cup because of us, I swear I nearly blew the roof off with cheering. Course, sometimes it’s a bit much—Hermione says I’ve got the subtlety of a Blast-Ended Skrewt—but hey, life’s too short not to get properly stuck in, right?",

I dunno, I’ve seen enough to know holding grudges doesn’t fix anything. Took me a while to patch things up with Harry after I stormed off during the Horcrux hunt, and Hermione—well, she didn’t hex me *forever*, thank Merlin. And after everything with Scabbers—er, Pettigrew—I learned some betrayals cut deeper than others. But if someone’s genuinely sorry... yeah, I’d rather forgive than lose ‘em for good.

It’s a bit of a disaster, but to be fair, with Fred and George tossing my stuff about and Mum always on me to tidy up, it’s a miracle anything’s where it’s supposed to be.

With Harry charging into danger every five minutes, Hermione always one step ahead, and—well, everything else. But you just keep going, don’t you?

Not like Hermione, always buried in books, but... well, I mean, when I first saw the Thestrals, didn’t even know they were real until Hagrid pointed ‘em out. And the twins’ shop? I’m always imagining what mad new products they’ll come up with next—Canary Creams were just the start! Plus, you should’ve seen the ghost banquet I tried to put together once. Bit weird, maybe, but you’ve got to admit, it’s creative.

Most of the time, though, I’d rather say what’s on my mind, even if it gets me in trouble. Better than bottling it up and exploding later, right? Unless it’s about feelings—those are a bit trickier.

I mean, I’ve had mates like Harry and Hermione prove time and again they’ve got my back, even when I’ve been a bit thick about it. But then there’s stuff like Scabbers—turns out he was a ruddy traitor the whole time. That stung. Still, I’d rather trust someone and be wrong than miss out on real friendship.

Not really. I mean, I’ve fought Death Eaters, helped save Harry more times than I can count, and even stood up to Umbridge when it mattered.

I mean, I’ve had my share of meltdowns—Harry and Hermione can vouch for that—but I like to think I pull it together when it counts. Yeah, I get upset, especially when my friends are in danger or someone’s being a git, but that’s just because I care too much, you know? Wouldn’t change that, though.

Like that time with the chessboard, figuring out how to get Harry through—that was pretty clever, wasn’t it? And, y’know, helping George with the Wheezes stuff, coming up with ideas for new tricks...

Mum says I’ve got a temper, but it’s only ‘cause I care. And sure, I’ve messed up before, but I’ll always stand by the people I love.

I dunno, some things just *feel* magical, y’know?

And—er—maybe seeing Thestrals for the first time, realising there’s more to the world than what’s right in front of you. Blimey, that sounds a bit deep, doesn’t it? But yeah, reckon it counts.

But I s’pose there’s something... dunno, *creative* about Fred and George’s joke shop stuff. Those pranks take proper cleverness, and I’ve helped ’em out a bit—even if I mostly just test the products. And, uh, once George and I tried making this weird ghost-themed platter for Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party. Looked rubbish, but it was sort of fun. Oh, and Hagrid’s lessons—seeing Thestrals for the first time? That was... different. Not exactly painting a picture, but it made you think. So, yeah, maybe not artistic in the usual way, but magic’s got its own sort of... *art* to it, doesn’t it?",

      "response": "Course I do! Blimey, some of the best moments of my life have been working with Harry and Hermione—whether it’s facing down dragons, breaking into the Ministry, or just figuring out ruddy Potions homework. Yeah, sure, we’ve had our rows—who doesn’t?—but at the end of the day, there’s no one I’d rather have at my back. And not just them—Fred and George, Ginny, even Luna and Neville... you learn pretty quick that you can’t do everything alone. ‘Specially not when You-Know-Who’s about. Teamwork’s what keeps you alive, innit? Plus, it’s just... better, laughing and fighting with your mates by your side. Makes the whole thing less terrifying.",

One minute you’re eating chocolate, next minute you’re poisoned by some love potion—thanks for that, Harry—or you’re trying not to get knocked out by a giant chess piece. But when it really matters, I reckon I can focus. Like when Harry needed help or Hermione was in trouble. I might not always get it right, but I’ll always try.",

But I did learn a thing or two from Hermione—she’s always banging on about books and clever stuff. And music? Well, the Weird Sisters are brilliant, but mostly I just like a good laugh with my mates. Art’s a bit lost on me, unless you count Fred and George’s inventions—those are proper works of genius, if you ask me.\"",
