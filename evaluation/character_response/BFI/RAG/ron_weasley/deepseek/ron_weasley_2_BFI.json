      "response": "Blimey, yeah, I s’pose I can be talkative—sometimes too much, according to Hermione. But when it matters, like when Harry’s bottling things up or we’re in a tight spot, I’ll say what needs saying. Bit of a habit from growing up in a big family, really—if you don’t talk, you don’t get heard. Though I’ve learned the hard way that not every thought needs blurtin’ out... *laughs awkwardly* Still, better than bein’ silent when your mates need you, right?",

But it’s not like I go *looking* for faults in others. It’s more... I dunno, sometimes things just get to me, and I say things I don’t mean. Like with Hermione or Harry—I’ve mucked things up before because I felt rubbish about myself, not because they were actually doing anything wrong. But I always regret it after. When it *really* matters, I’ve got their backs. Always will.",

I mean, I might not be perfect—blimey, I’ve messed up loads—but when it comes down to it, I’ll always have my mates’ backs. Like when I helped Harry during the Triwizard Tournament or stood up to Umbridge. And, well, running the joke shop with George—takes proper work, that, even if it’s a laugh. Just... don’t ask me about Divination homework. That was a lost cause.",

You’ve got to keep moving, right? Family and friends pull you through, even when it feels like the world’s gone mad. And sometimes, you just need a good laugh or a game of chess to shake it off.

Like that ghostly platter I whipped up for the spirits, or helping George test new joke shop stuff. It’s not always perfect, but sometimes… you just get a gut feeling, y’know?

I mean, sure, I’ve had my moments where I’ve felt a bit rubbish or out of my depth—like when I first got to Hogwarts or when Harry and I had that massive row—but I’ve never been one to keep my mouth shut, have I? I’ll always stand up for my mates, even if it means making a prat of myself. And let’s be honest, I’m usually the one cracking jokes or arguing about something, even when maybe I shouldn’t.

Thing is, when it really matters, I’d do anything for my mates. Sacrificed myself in that bloody chess game, didn’t I? And I’ve stuck by Harry and Hermione through all the mad stuff we’ve faced, even when it meant breaking rules or risking my neck. Sometimes you just... *know* when someone needs you, and you step up.

Or when we crashed Dad’s flying car into the Whomping Willow. Bloody terrifying, that. But, you know, I usually manage to scrape through... somehow.

Dragons, Death Eaters, bloody *chessboards* that try to knock your head off—yeah, stress and me go way back. But... I reckon I handle it alright when it counts. Sure, I might panic a bit first—who wouldn’t?—but when my friends are in trouble, I pull it together. Doesn’t mean I’m not terrified half the time, though. Just... don’t tell Harry I said that.",

And Fred and George—sorry, *George*—always had me wondering what mad invention they’d come up with next. Though, er, maybe not *too* curious—learned that the hard way with some of their tricks. But yeah, reckon there’s loads of fascinating things out there, especially when you’ve got mates like Harry and Hermione dragging you into it. Sometimes too much, if you ask me—Hermione’s mad for cramming in every class, and I’m just trying to keep up!",

Between dodging bloody love potions, playing life-sized Wizard’s Chess, and keeping up with Harry and Hermione’s mad adventures, you’ve got to be. Though I’ll admit, sometimes it’s more “panic energy” than the fun sort. But hey, that’s what chocolate frogs and a good laugh with mates are for, right?",

Mostly when I’m being a git and letting my temper or jealousy get the better of me. But it’s never because I *want* to fight—it’s usually because I’m worried or feel like I’m not measuring up. And, er, I always regret it after. Unless it’s Malfoy. Then I’ll start a quarrel any day.",

Sure, I’ve had my moments where things got a bit... messy, but when it really counts, I’m there. Like when Harry needed me or when the Aurors needed a bit of dodging advice during the Calamity. Might not always get it right straight off, but I don’t give up. And hey, if you’re asking if I’ll nick off early for a bite, well... only if it’s really good food.",

      "response": "Blimey, tense? Yeah, course I can be tense! You’d be tense too if you’d seen half the stuff I have—watching Harry face dragons, dodging curses, or hearing Moody go on about possession like it’s nothing. And don’t even get me started on time travel or watching Hagrid come back all battered after dealing with ruddy giants. But you know what? That’s when you find out what you’re made of. You stay tense, yeah, but you don’t back down. Not when your friends need you.",

      "response": "*scratches head, grinning a bit* \n\nI dunno about \"deep thinker\"—that's more Hermione's thing, isn't it? But I reckon I’ve had my moments. Like in chess, or when I’ve had to think quick in a tight spot. Mostly, I just... do what feels right. Sometimes it works, sometimes it’s a right mess, but I’d rather jump in than overthink it. Blimey, if I sat around pondering everything like Hermione, we’d never get anything done! *laughs* Though, er... maybe that’s not always a bad thing.",

And when something really brilliant happens—like when I got that Special Award or when Krum caught the Snitch—I reckon I cheer louder than anyone. Course, sometimes it’s just me and my mates, but that’s enough to get me going. Enthusiasm? Yeah, I’ve got loads of that. Even if I’m rubbish at something, I’ll still give it a go with a bit of a laugh. That’s what matters, right?",

      "response": "Blimey... I s’pose I *try* to be forgiving, but it’s not always easy, is it? I mean, I’ve had my moments—like when Harry forgave me after I bailed on him and Hermione during the Horcrux hunt. But then there’s times when it stings so bad you can’t just shrug it off, like with Scabbers—er, Pettigrew—or when Hermione hexed me after the whole Lavender mess. Reckon I’m more likely to forgive if someone’s genuinely sorry, though. And if they’re family or proper mates... well, you’d do anything for them, wouldn’t you? Even if they’ve been a right git.",

      "response": "Oh, blimey—disorganized? Yeah, I s’pose so. Always forgettin’ stuff or losin’ things, like that time I ended up in the kitchens instead of McGonagall’s office. But, y’know, when it really matters, I pull it together. Like in the battles or helpin’ Harry—somehow, I just... *do* it. Mum’d probably say I’m a mess, but hey, it works out. Mostly.",

      "id": 19,
      "question": "Do you worry a lot?",
      "response": "Blimey, yeah, I do worry a lot. Not that I like admitting it, but when your best mate’s Harry Potter and you’re constantly dodging dark wizards and hunting bits of You-Know-Who’s soul, it’s hard not to. Sometimes it’s the big stuff—like Harry disappearing or Rita Skeeter spouting rubbish—and other times it’s just... little things. But I reckon worrying means you care, right? And I’d rather care too much than not at all. Even if it does my head in sometimes.",

      "question": "Do you have an active imagination?",
      "response": "Blimey, ‘course I do! I mean, have you seen Thestrals? Or Fred and George’s joke shop stuff? Half the time, I’m imagining what it’d be like to pull off some mad prank or invent something wicked—like that ghostly platter I tried making once. And, er, sometimes I reckon I imagine myself doing something really brave, like in chess or Quidditch. Not that I always pull it off, but—well, a bloke can dream, right?",

      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you tend to be quiet?",
      "response": "Quiet? Nah, not really. I mean, I talk plenty—unless it’s about something proper serious, or if I’m in a strop about something. But when Harry or Hermione go quiet, that’s when it gets to me. Feels like the whole room’s holding its breath, you know? Like when Harry shut me out after the Triwizard Tournament or when Hermione ignored me after the Yule Ball. Blimey, silence can be worse than shouting sometimes. But if my mates need me, I’ll always speak up—even if it’s just to say something daft to lighten the mood.",

      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you generally trusting?",
      "response": "Well, blimey, that’s a tough one. I mean, I *want* to trust people—like, I’d trust Harry and Hermione with my life, no question. But after everything we’ve been through—Scabbers turning out to be a ruddy traitor, Moody being impersonated, even blokes like Regulus Black having hidden agendas—you learn to be a bit careful. Still, I reckon if someone’s proven themselves, like my family or my best mates, I’ll stick by ‘em no matter what. Just don’t expect me to take everything at face value anymore. Learned that the hard way.",

      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you tend to be lazy?",
      "response": "Blimey, lazy? I mean—maybe a bit when it comes to boring stuff like Divination or cleaning out Errol’s droppings, but not when it matters. Like, if Harry or Hermione need me, or if there’s a fight? I’ll be there, no question. Even when I’m knackered or doubting myself, I’ve never just sat back and let my mates down. Unless there’s pudding involved—then I might take a quick break.",

      "response": "Blimey, emotionally stable? Not exactly my strong suit, if I'm honest. I mean, I’ve had my share of meltdowns—Harry and I nearly hexed each other’s heads off once over—well, loads of things. But when it comes down to it, I’d do anything for my mates. Yeah, I get upset, but that’s ‘cause I care. And if someone’s hurting my friends, that’s when I’m at my best, even if I’m a bit of a wreck the rest of the time.",

      "response": "Well, blimey—inventive? I dunno if I’d call *myself* that, not like Fred and George, anyway. But... I s’pose I’ve had my moments, yeah? Like that time with the chessboard—figured out how to get Harry and Hermione through, even if it meant taking one for the team. And, er, once at the shop, I helped come up with this weird ghost-themed snack—tasted alright, even if it looked like something Peeves would chuck at you. Mostly, I just... wing it and hope for the best. Works out sometimes!",

      "response": "Uh... well, I dunno about *assertive*, exactly. I mean, I’ve got my moments—like standing up to Harry when he’s being a git or throwing myself into danger for my friends. But I’m not exactly barking orders like Hermione or charging in like Harry. Mostly, I just... do what feels right, even if it’s scary. Sometimes that means speaking up, sometimes it means sticking by someone when they need it. Blimey, I sound like a right prat saying it out loud, don’t I?",

Felt like rubbish, honestly. But it’s hard to stay that way for long when you’ve got people who actually *care* about you, y’know?

      "response": "Oh, blimey—persevere? Yeah, I reckon I do. Maybe not always the brightest or the bravest, but when it matters, I stick it out. Like that time in first year with the chess game—I wasn’t about to let Harry and Hermione down, even if it meant getting knocked out cold. Or when we fought Delphi—proper terrifying, that was, but we didn’t back down. Sometimes you just have to dig in, even if your knees are shaking. ‘S what friends do, innit?",

Like when I thought Harry was—well, you know—or when I ate that bloody poisoned chocolate and nearly kicked it. But honestly, it’s hard not to get a bit twisted up when you’re scared for your mates or feeling like you’re not good enough. Still, I reckon I bounce back alright in the end. Hermione says I’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon, so maybe that’s why.",

Like, watching Thestrals for the first time, or seeing the twins’ shop come to life with all their mad inventions. And... well, Hermione’s always going on about books and music, and sometimes I catch myself liking it too, even if I’d never admit it. Oh, and Quidditch! That’s got to count, right?

Like, there was this time I tried asking Fleur Delacour to the ball—ended up mumbling something daft and bolting like a frightened Hippogriff. And when Harry and I had that massive row in fourth year, I was too scared to talk to him properly, even though I knew I’d messed up. But, uh—I dunno, when it really matters, I try to push through it. Like standing by Harry when things get rough, even if my knees are shaking.

Like with Harry and Hermione, or even Dobby… you just do what’s right when it matters. And, er, family’s everything. Even when I muck up, I’d do anything for them.

Like, remember that time with the Canary Creams? Brilliant, but not exactly *planned*. And sure, I’ve bungled stuff—like in exams—but when it really matters, I reckon I pull through.

But, uh, I’ve learned that’s not always helpful. When it really matters, though—like when my friends are in danger—I somehow pull it together. Doesn’t mean my hands aren’t shaking or my stomach isn’t doing backflips, but I’ll stand my ground. It’s like... you just do what you’ve got to do, even if you’re terrified.

Even at the joke shop with George, it’s chaos, but that’s what makes it brilliant. Sure, sometimes you want a bit of normal, like a proper game of chess or a quiet meal at the Burrow, but life’s more interesting when it’s not predictable.

I love a good laugh, cracking jokes with mates, and—well, I’ve been known to chat a bit too much during Wizard’s Chess matches.

Like when I called Hermione a know-it-all or made that stupid joke about her at the party. I don’t always think before I speak, and it’s cost me, especially with the people I care about. But I swear, I never mean it to hurt them—not really. It’s just... sometimes I get jealous or angry, and it all comes out wrong. I’ve messed up, but I’d do anything to make it right.

Like that time Hermione and I tried to get Rose and Albus talking again—bloody awkward, but we made it work in the end. And blimey, half the stuff we did at Hogwarts was just winging it—saving Buckbeak, sneaking off to Hogsmeade, even that whole mess with Lavender...

Like when Harry vanished into some dodgy tunnel or when we thought he was possessed… Merlin’s beard, that was rough. But you know what? Even when my hands are shaking or I feel like my stomach’s in knots, I’ve got my mates beside me. That helps. And sometimes, you just have to push through it, even if you’re terrified.

Gotta think a few moves ahead, even if I’d rather just jump in. And when it’s about Fred... well, that’s when the ideas feel heavier, like they’re not just mine anymore. But when it’s with Harry and Hermione, or messin’ round with the twins, that’s when it’s fun—like the world’s one big puzzle waitin’ to be cracked.

Fred and George’s joke shop stuff—that’s practically art, the way they invent things. And, uh, once I tried making this weird platter for ghosts with George. Looked terrifying but tasted alright, so that’s something, right? Mostly, though, I’m more about Quidditch and chess—though I reckon chess is a bit like art if you think about it.

Blimey, some of the best moments of my life have been workin’ alongside Harry and Hermione—sneakin’ into Hogsmeade, savin’ Buckbeak, even all that mad stuff with the Horcruxes. Yeah, sure, we’ve had our rows—who hasn’t?—but at the end of the day, there’s nothin’ stronger than havin’ your mates beside you. Even when I’ve been a git, they’ve stuck by me, and I’d do the same for them. Teamwork’s what gets you through the tough bits, innit?",

Like in Wizard’s Chess, or when Harry needed that bezoar—I might not always look like I’ve got my head on straight, but I’ll always pull through for my mates.",

Hermione’s always going on about books and all that, and Fred and George were brilliant with their inventions, but I’m more about, you know, being there for my mates when it counts. Though, blimey, I did enjoy those Canary Creams—that was proper clever, that was.",
