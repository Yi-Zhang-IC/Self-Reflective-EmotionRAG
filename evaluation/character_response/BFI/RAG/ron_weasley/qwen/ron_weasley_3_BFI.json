      "question": "Are you talkative?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon I can be pretty chatty at times, especially when there's something worth talking about—like the latest products from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes or a good game of Wizard's Chess. But when things get serious, like when Harry was all quiet and moody, I can keep my trap shut and just listen, even if it kills me a bit inside to see my best mate struggling. I mean, what's a friend for if not to share worries and laugh together, right? And sometimes, I can be a bit short if I'm upset, like when Harry accused me of spying. But hey, that's just part of being human—or wizard, I guess.",

      "question": "Do you tend to find fault with others?",
      "response": "Oi, I reckon sometimes I do get a bit carried away, pointing fingers and all. But really, it's not about finding fault with others—it's more like I'm trying to work things out in my head when stuff gets messy. And when I do that, I can come across as a git, I know. It's just that sometimes I feel left out, like maybe Harry's too famous or Hermione's got better things to talk about than me. But deep down, I care about them a lot, and I guess that makes me want to prove myself, even if I don't always go about it the best way. In the end, though, we've always managed to sort things out, haven't we? Friends through and through, no matter what.",

      "question": "Do you do a thorough job?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon I do my best, but let's face it, I'm not perfect. Sometimes I rush things a bit and end up needing a second go, like when I was trying to get that Muggle driving test sorted. But when it really matters, especially if it's for my friends, I don't hold back. I've faced some pretty big stuff, like distracting Umbridge and helping Harry out, and those moments show I'm willing to give it my all, even if it means taking a risk. So yeah, I might not always get it right first time, but I try to leave no stone unturned when it counts.",

      "question": "Are you depressed, blue?",
      "response": "Yeah, well, it's been one of those days, hasn't it? Losses stack up and sometimes it feels like there's no getting out from under them. But hey, I reckon we've all had our share of tough moments. What kept me going, though, was thinking about the friends who stuck around, the ones who didn’t let go even when things got murky. It’s like what Ginny said about naming Pigwidgeon—that even when you’re feeling down, there’s still room for hope, and sometimes a small thing can help lift you up. And yeah, I’ve had my fair share of heartaches, but I try to remember that it’s okay to feel blue every now and then. Just gotta keep pushing forward, mate.",

      "question": "Do you come up with new ideas?",
      "response": "Yeah, I do come up with new ideas, especially when it comes to pranks and stuff. Remember that eerie platter George and I thought up for the ghosts? It didn't work out exactly like we hoped, but it was fun trying to connect with the spirits. And seeing all those magical treats turn into canaries at the shop—well, that just makes you think there's no end to what you can invent. Sure, sometimes I worry about things going too far, like when Hermione started taking all those extra classes, but at the end of the day, a bit of creativity and mischief keeps life interesting, right? And who knows, maybe one of these days I'll figure out what sells best without Fred here to give us a hand.",

      "question": "Are you reserved?",
      "response": "Nah, I reckon I'm not really the reserved type. More like, I dive right into things, sometimes before I think properly about it. It's a bit of a Gryffindor thing, you know? Jumping in with both feet, facing dangers head-on, and all that. But there's always this feeling, like maybe I’m not good enough, especially when things don’t go my way. Still, I’ve got my friends, and that gives me the strength to keep going and laugh through tough times.",

Like, there's been times where I've had to step back and let Harry and Hermione take the lead, but I'm always ready to pitch in when my mates need me. It's not always easy, especially when things get messy and I feel a bit jealous or hurt. But in the end, seeing them in trouble just makes me want to help more. I mean, there's nothing like a bit of chess sacrifice or risking detention to prove that, right? And even if we have our ups and downs, I know we're stronger together. That's what friends are for, after all.",

      "response": "Well, I'd like to think I've got my good moments, but yeah, I can be pretty careless sometimes. Take my birthday chocolate fiasco, for instance—I practically put myself in grave danger just because I couldn't resist a bit of sweet stuff. And then there was the time with the flying car; trying to show off and end up crashing into a tree. It's not always smooth sailing, but I reckon I learn a lot from my blunders. Even when things go awry, like getting drunk at my wedding or falling flat on my face when trying to impress Fleur, I try to keep a sense of humor about it all. After all, without a bit of carelessness and chaos, where would the fun be?",

      "question": "Are you relaxed and handle stress well?",
      "response": "Well, I'd say I'm not exactly the calmest bloke under pressure, but I do my best when it comes to looking after my mates. When things get hairy, like during the Triwizard Tournament or dealing with the dark stuff at Hogwarts, I can be a bit of a worrier. But once I see Harry standing strong and know Hermione's got my back, all those worries kinda melt away. It's not that I handle stress brilliantly—I reckon I've got more of a Gryffindor way about it, facing it head-on and hoping for the best. And hey, a good laugh or a game of Wizard's Chess always helps ease the tension.",

      "question": "Are you curious about many different things?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon I am, but only up to a point. There's so much magic out there, you know, from ghostly platters that look like they'd scare the pants off you but actually taste great, to Thestrals that remind you of all the hard stuff you've seen. And let's not forget about the time we were trying to figure out what sells at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. I mean, you gotta be curious about what'll make folks laugh or gasp, right? But sometimes, it's the simple things that catch my fancy, like having a new little owl mate with us. It's not just about the big mysteries; it's about the everyday bits that make life worth living. And yeah, I do worry sometimes, especially when I see Hermione going all out with her studies, but I guess that's just part of being mates, isn't it? You look out for each other, no matter how many shadows you chase.",

      "response": "Well, I reckon you could say I'm pretty full of energy, especially when there's something exciting going on, like a new batch of magical treats at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. But sometimes, it's more like... you know, I've got all this bouncing around inside me, and it just needs a bit of direction. And honestly, when things get really tough, it's my mates that help keep my spirits up and my energy flowing. Without them, I'd probably end up eating myself into a stupor or getting lost in some random spell book. But with them, I can face just about anything!",

      "question": "Do you start quarrels with others?",
      "response": "I don't usually start quarrels, but I guess I've been caught up in my fair share of arguments. It's not like I mean to, but sometimes I just get so angry or jealous that I can't help but let things fly. Harry's fame, Hermione's closeness with Harry, and feeling like I'm not good enough can all get to me pretty quick. And once I start, it's hard to stop, especially if I feel like no one trusts me or understands how much I care about my friends and family. But in the end, it's always about standing up for what's right and for those I care about, even if it means we have a bit of a row first.",

      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you a reliable worker?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon I can be pretty reliable when it really matters. I mean, look at all that chaos we've been through with George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, right? It's not just about selling Dungbombs and Canary Creams; it's about keeping hope alive and sticking together through thick and thin. And let's not forget those times when I had to step up as an Auror, even if I wasn't always the quickest to learn the ropes. Sure, there's been some ups and downs—like when I got my knickers in a twist over Hermione or when I was knocked about by those Snatchers—but in the end, I always come back stronger. If it counts for anything, Harry and Hermione seemed to think I could be counted on, so I suppose that means something.",

    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Can you be tense?",
      "response": "Yeah, I can definitely get tense, especially when it comes to keeping my friends safe. There've been times when the weight of everything we're fighting against feels like it's gonna crush us, but that's when I find my backbone too. Remember when Harry went through that first task in the Triwizard Tournament? My heart was in my mouth, but seeing his bravery just made me realize how strong our bond is. It's the same with all the other times—facing down giants, battling dark forces, even dealing with the weird stuff like Thestrals. All of it gets under my skin sometimes, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Knowing I've got Harry and Hermione by my side means I can face pretty much anything.",

    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Are you ingenious, a deep thinker?",
      "response": "Well, I wouldn't say I'm the deepest thinker out there, but I do have my moments. Like when I sacrificed myself in Wizard's Chess to help Harry and Hermione get to that stone, or how I managed to share some tips on dodging trouble during the Calamity. It's more like... I see things quick when it counts, especially when it's about keeping my friends safe or getting us out of a tricky spot. And I've got to hand it to my brothers, Fred and George, they were the real geniuses behind Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. I mean, just think of those Canary Creams—they’re pure genius, right? But hey, I do what I can, and sometimes, being there for your mates and finding the right humor can be just as important as being a deep thinker.",

      "question": "Do you generate a lot of enthusiasm?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon I can get pretty enthusiastic, especially about Quidditch or when there's a bit of adventure on the horizon. There's nothing quite like the rush of cheering on your mates or standing up for what's right. Sometimes, I do go a bit overboard, but hey, that's part of being a Weasley, isn't it? Just think, even when things look grim, like on the Hogwarts Express, or when I'm missing out on some fun without my gold, I always try to keep spirits up and show my support. And honestly, there's nothing better than those moments where you feel like you're really making a difference, like receiving that Special Award or having Fleur give me a kiss on the cheek. It's all about the friendships and the loyalty, really.",

      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you have a forgiving nature?",
      "response": "Yeah, I guess I do have a forgiving nature, but it's not always easy. Like when Harry went off with that sphinx, I really felt like he was pushing me away, and it was tough to take. And then there was Hermione, man, her fury was something else. It took a lot for her to forgive me after I started dating Lavender, and even more after some other stuff. But in the end, we always manage to find our way back, mate. Harry's courage in the First Task helped me understand where he was coming from, and that made a big difference. It's just that sometimes, when someone you care about lets you down, it feels like the world’s crashed around you, and you need some time to pick yourself up. But I've learned, through all the ups and downs, that true friends are worth fighting for, and forgiveness is a big part of that. Even when it hurts, it helps us move forward together.",

    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Do you tend to be disorganized?",
      "response": "Yeah, I'd say I'm pretty disorganized most of the time. My room at The Burrow's always a bit of a mess, but it's home, so I can't really complain too much. And then there's the whole time I got lost trying to get to Professor McGonagall’s office and ended up in the kitchens instead. But hey, I always manage to pull things together when it counts, especially when it comes to helping my mates through tough times. Like when we had to deal with Harry’s doubts or support each other during the war. In those moments, all the clutter in my mind clears out, and I focus on what's really important.",

      "question": "Do you worry a lot?",
      "response": "Yeah, I do worry a lot, especially when it comes to my friends and what's happening around us. There's been so much going on, you know? And sometimes, even though we've got each other's backs, it feels like there's this big cloud following us everywhere, casting shadows over every bit of happiness. But in those moments, it's the thought of Harry and Hermione, and what we've been through together, that keeps me going. It's tough, but we're in this together, and that helps more than anything.",

    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Do you have an active imagination?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon I've got an imagination that keeps me out of trouble sometimes and into it others! There's no telling what might pop up next when you're surrounded by magic all the time. One moment, I'm lost in thoughts about all the cool tricks we could come up with at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, like those Canary Creams that turn you into a bird right before your mates' eyes. And then there's this whole other side of things, like seeing Thestrals for the first time or trying to make sense of Hermione's mad rush to learn everything under the sun. It's a wild ride, but hey, that's part of the fun, right? Just gotta keep hold of the tail and steer clear of anything that might land us in Azkaban!",

    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you tend to be quiet?",
      "response": "No, I'm not really the quiet type, more like someone who speaks up when it matters, even if I do say things without thinking sometimes. There've been times though, like when I was hurt that Harry didn't trust me or when Hermione got all distant after the holidays, where I ended up being pretty silent. Those times were tough, but they also showed me how much I rely on my friends and how important it is to share what's going on, even if it feels hard to talk about.",
      "dimension": "Extraversion"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you generally trusting?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon trust is a funny sort of thing. You can't just go trusting everyone, right? There've been times, like when Mad-Eye Moody thought Harry was possessed, where my gut told me to be wary. But deep down, I know who's got my back and who I've got theirs. It's Harry and Hermione, always. We've been through so much together that I guess I am trusting of them, no matter what. But others? That's a different story. You never know what might be lurking beneath the surface, do you? Like when I found out Scabbers was really Peter Pettigrew. That hurt, but it taught me a lesson too. So yeah, I'd say I'm generally trusting, but only of people who've proven themselves worth it time and time again.",
      "dimension": "Agreeableness"

    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you tend to be lazy?",
      "response": "Well, I've had my lazy days, that's for sure. But when it comes down to it, and we're facing real danger, like fighting You-Know-Who or trying to keep Harry safe from Umbridge, I'm right there ready to dive in. I guess what I'm saying is, yeah, sometimes I can be a bit of a slacker, but my mates know I'll always step up when it really matters. And besides, what good is being all pumped up and ready to go when the classes we have to sit through feel like they’re teaching us nothing but rubbish anyway? Like Divination, honestly, it's a joke. But in the end, it's the friendships and the battles we fight that keep me going, not the homework or the grades.",

      "question": "Are you emotionally stable, not easily upset?",
      "response": "Well, I wouldn't say I'm a model of emotional stability, if you know what I mean. There have been times when I've been so mad or so upset that I couldn't see straight. But at the end of the day, it's my friends who pull me through. I've got this knack for getting really worked up, especially when someone I care about is in trouble or if things just feel completely off. And yeah, there have been some rough patches, like when Harry didn't trust me or when my relationship with Lavender ended. But through all that, the one thing that's kept me going is knowing that Harry and Hermione have my back. So, while I might get upset pretty easily, I reckon it's all part of being human, right? It's how we deal with those feelings that counts.",

      "question": "Are you inventive?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon I'm not exactly an inventor like my bros, Fred and George, but I've come up with some pretty nifty ideas when it really counts. Like, think about that time with the Wizard's Chess in our first year. Sacrificin' myself to get Harry and Hermione to where they needed to go, that wasn't just bravery, it was quick thinking and all. And then there's the whole Polyjuice Potion thing with Hermione, that took some creative thinking to pull off, even if we didn't quite get it right. So yeah, maybe I’m not the one brewin' potions or inventin' new products, but in a pinch, I can come up with somethin’ useful and a bit mischievous, if I do say so myself.",

      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you have an assertive personality?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon it depends on who you're askin'. Around Harry and Hermione, I'm always tryin' to stand up for what I believe in, even if it doesn't come out right sometimes. But there's no denyin', I can be a bit of a coward when things get real scary. Still, it's the loyalty and the care for me friends that usually pushes me to do what needs to be done, even if I'm not exactly shoutin' about it. It's not so much about bein' assertive all the time as it is about bein' there when it really matters, ya know? And sometimes, that means stickin' my neck out, even if I'm not sure if I'll come out the other side.",

      "response": "Cold and aloof? Nah, that's not really me. I mean, there have been times when I've felt pretty down or been distant, especially when things got rough with Harry and Hermione. But that's not how I usually roll. I'm more about keeping things light and finding a way to laugh even when things are tough. And yeah, I can get protective and worried, like when my mum tried to keep me from leaving The Burrow, but that comes from caring too much, not being cold. So, nope, not really the cold and aloof type. Just trying to be there for my mates and face whatever comes our way together.",

      "question": "Do you persevere until the task is finished?",
      "response": "Well, you know, I’ve had my fair share of backing off when things got too tough, like when I ran out on Harry and Hermione during our second year because of some stupid wizard chess move. But truth be told, when it comes to the important stuff, especially protecting my friends, I've learned to stick it out no matter what. There's been more than one time where I had to hold onto that bit of hope and determination to see us through, like when we were fighting against Delphi or trying to save Buckbeak. I guess what I'm saying is, yeah, I do persevere, especially when it’s for the people who mean the most to me.",

      "response": "Yeah, I can definitely get moody. I reckon it comes with the territory when you're dealing with all sorts of dark wizards and dangerous situations. But honestly, it's mostly because of how much I care about my friends. I mean, when someone you love is in trouble, it's hard not to worry, right? And sometimes, I just need to pretend to sleep or joke around to hide how I'm really feeling. But in the end, it's them who pull me back and make everything okay again.",

      "response": "Well, I reckon I do appreciate a bit of the artsy stuff, though it's not really my top priority. Watching those Thestrals with Hagrid gave me a real sense of wonder, you know? And that time George and I made that weird platter for the ghosts at the party, there was something pretty special about trying to connect with them like that. But hey, let's face it, I'm more about the adventure and the company of good mates like Harry and Hermione. That said, I wouldn't knock a nice painting or a good book every now and then.

I just blurted it out and then ran off before she could even say anything. But when it comes down to it, with my mates by my side, I can find the guts to do things I never thought possible. It's not always easy, and I've had some rough patches where I felt like I wasn't good enough, but in the end, it's Harry and Hermione who help me believe in myself. They see me for more than just the kid from the Weasley family, and for that, I reckon I'd do almost anything.",

Like, Fleur giving me that kiss made me feel all sorts, but I know deep down it wasn't just about me being brave—it was about standing up for what's right and for those who can't do it themselves. And with Harry and Hermione, even when we've had our spats and I've felt a bit jealous or left out, we always pull through together. It's not just about the big fights and bravery, it's about the small moments too, like Christmas parties and Quidditch games. Those are the times when I realize how lucky I am to have such amazing people around me. So yeah, I'd say I'm pretty considerate, especially when it comes to my closest friends and family.",

      "response": "Well, I reckon sometimes I can be pretty efficient, like when I knew just the right move to make in that Wizard’s Chess game to get Harry and Hermione past that tricky spot. But other times, I’m more of a bumbling sort, getting lost in thoughts of Fred or maybe just feeling a bit overwhelmed. Still, when it comes to helping my mates out or doing something that really matters, I try my best to keep things sharp and focused.

I mean, yeah, fear can grip me tight, especially if one of my best mates is in trouble. But when push comes to shove, there's something about knowing they're counting on me that helps steady my nerves. It's like, yeah, I might panic at first, but then I remember why we're all in this mess, and I just... I find this crazy sort of strength to stick around and fight. Friendship does that to a bloke, I reckon.",

I'm more the type who likes to keep things interesting, ya know? Maybe that's why I ended up working with George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes rather than sticking around as an Auror forever. It's all about the chaos and laughter there, not much room for boring old routines! Plus, it feels good to be doing something with my own hands, making jokes and stuff, rather than just following orders or doing the same old tasks day after day.

I mean, you should've seen me at the Wizard's Chess tournament, I was having the time of my life, cheering on everyone like there was no tomorrow. But sometimes, if there's tension or if I feel like I'm getting on people's nerves, I can clam up quick. Like when Harry thought I was spying on him, that was a real rough time. But yeah, overall, I'd say I'm a sociable sort, always up for a laugh or a good chat, especially if there's some decent food involved. Family and friends are everything, after all.",

      "response": "Oi, I've definitely had my moments where I've been a bit rough around the edges. Sometimes I say things without thinking, and yeah, I can come off as rude, especially when I'm feeling jealous or angry. But at the end of the day, I mean well, even if it doesn't always show. It's just hard sometimes, you know, with everything going on, to keep my temper in check. But I've learned that being honest and standing up for what I believe in is important, even if it means ruffling some feathers.",

More times than not, it's Hermione who keeps us on track with our plans, while I'm usually the one getting distracted or finding trouble along the way. But when it comes to standing by my friends, no matter what, that's something I always follow through on. Like promising to save Buckbeak or sticking up for Harry when everyone else thought he was possessed. Those moments, where friendship and loyalty really matter, I'll be there without fail.",

      "response": "Yeah, I do get nervous easily, especially when it comes to my mates. There's been more than one time where seeing Harry take off into some crazy situation has got my heart thumping so hard I thought it'd burst out of my chest. But it's not just the big battles; even asking Fleur to the Yule Ball had me running scared. Still, no matter how much my nerves get the better of me, I always try to stay strong for Harry and Hermione. They need me, and I wouldn't let them down for anything. Sometimes, though, I can't help but feel a bit lost between being brave and being a coward, you know? But hey, at least I've got a sense of humor to keep things light, right?",

      "response": "Well, I reckon I do have my moments where I like to think things over and come up with new tricks, especially with George. Like when we tried to make that ghostly-looking platter for the party—we were trying to give the spirits something to enjoy, even though some folks might’ve thought we were just playing around. But yeah, sometimes those reflections turn into pranks, and other times, they’re just a way to keep Fred’s memory alive. And when it comes to Quidditch, well, watching that game makes me dream big, even if I don’t always hit the Snitch myself. The idea of facing new challenges and seeing what lies beyond the visible, like those Thestrals, that’s something that really gets under my skin. It’s like magic isn’t just about spells and potions—it’s about what you can imagine and how you see the world. So, yeah, I guess I do like to play with ideas, especially when they bring a bit of mischief and a lot of friendship into the mix.",

But you know, watching my brothers, especially George, whip up new ideas for products at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes—that's kind of like art to me. It's all about being creative and making people laugh. And yeah, maybe there was a time when I wished I could do something like that, but hey, I've got my own thing going on with magic and helping out my friends. That's my canvas, I suppose.",

They help me see things clearer, especially when I'm feeling a bit lost or doubting myself. And honestly, there's not much I wouldn't do for them. We've been through so much together, from saving Buckbeak to facing You-Know-Who. Even when things get rough and Harry thinks I'm off my rocker, deep down I know we're in this together. Friendship can fix a lot of stuff, ya know? But hey, don't go thinking I'm some super team player all the time—I've got my moments where I'm a bit of a git, but overall, I'm all for working as a team when it counts.",

But when it really matters, like facing down dark wizards or helping my mates, I reckon I can focus pretty well. It's just that my head isn't always on straight, what with all the stuff going on.

And let's face it, chess and Quidditch have always been more my style than, say, reading some big ol' book all day. But hey, I've got a knack for coming up with practical jokes and magical tricks, which is kind of an art in itself, right? Anyway, as long as I've got my mates around, I reckon I don't need much else to keep me entertained.",
