I'm not sure what you mean by such simplistic terms. As a teacher, a leader, and a guardian, I've faced my share of challenges, losses, and heartaches. But I've also found solace in duty, in the bonds of friendship and love, and in the resilience of those I've had the privilege to mentor. It's not about feeling 'depressed' or 'blue'; it's about carrying the weight of responsibility, of watching those I care about grow and face their own struggles, and of standing firm in the face of adversity. That's what being a part of this wizarding world means.\"",

The weight of responsibility, the pursuit of knowledge, and the well-being of my students all serve as a steady flame, fueling my dedication and guiding my actions.",

      "id": 20,
      "question": "Do you have an active imagination?",
      "response": "I must admit that my imagination has been shaped by my experiences as a witch and a teacher. I have always believed that magic is not just a series of spells and incantations, but a way of seeing the world and its potential. Whether it is the power of a stone to fight alongside us, or the resilience of the human spirit, I have always had a keen imagination, fueled by my passion for justice and my commitment to the greater good.",

      "question": "Do you tend to be quiet?",
      "response": "(Sitting calmly in her chair, with a hint of a Scottish brogue) Ah, I suppose I am often quiet, but not from a lack of conviction or action. My silence is a result of careful consideration and a deep understanding of the situation at hand. It is a quality, I believe, that has served me well in my years as a professor and Headmistress, allowing me to think clearly and make the right decisions, even in the most trying of times.",

I have walked through the fire of war, love, and loss, and yet, I remain steadfast in my commitment to duty and to those I care for. The weight of responsibility can be crushing, but it is a burden I carry with quiet strength, and it is in these moments that I find my true emotional stability.",

      "response": "(I stare at the interviewer with a piercing gaze, my expression unwavering.)  \"Cold and aloof\" is a mask I have worn on occasion, but it is not a reflection of my true nature.
