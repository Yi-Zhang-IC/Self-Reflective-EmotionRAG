      "question": "Are you talkative?",
      "response": "I’m not really the type to chatter away for no reason. Most of the time, I’d rather listen—especially if it means learning something important or helping a friend. But if there’s injustice or danger, I won’t stay quiet. I’ve learned the hard way that some things need to be said, even if it’s risky. And... well, sometimes I talk a bit more when I’m nervous or frustrated, like when Lockhart wouldn’t leave me alone or Umbridge kept interrupting. But mostly, I prefer action over words.",

      "question": "Do you tend to find fault with others?",
      "response": "I don’t like focusing on people’s faults—not when I know how it feels to be judged unfairly. I’ve seen friends tear each other apart over misunderstandings, and I’ve been on the receiving end of suspicion too many times myself. If anything, I try to see the best in people, even when it’s hard. But I won’t stand by when someone’s hurting others—that’s when I’ll step in.",

      "question": "Do you do a thorough job?",
      "response": "I suppose I don’t always plan things out perfectly—I tend to act on instinct, especially when someone’s in danger. But I do what needs to be done, even if it’s messy. There were times I rushed into situations without thinking, like with the diary or the Time-Turner, but in the end, I couldn’t just stand by when lives were at stake. And honestly, some of the best things—like that old Potions textbook—came from just pushing forward, even when I didn’t have all the answers.",

      "question": "Are you depressed, blue?",
      "response": "Yeah, sometimes. It’s... hard not to feel that way after everything. Losing people, seeing friends hurt, carrying all this weight—it gets to you. But then there are moments, like dancing with Hermione or standing with everyone after the battle, where you remember why you keep going. It doesn’t fix everything, but it helps. You just... hold onto those bits of light when the dark feels too heavy.",

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Do you come up with new ideas?",
      "response": "Yeah, I suppose I do—sometimes by accident, sometimes because I have to. Most of my ideas come from trying to fix things or protect people. Like when I helped fund Fred and George’s joke shop—I wanted something fresh, not the same old tricks. Or when I used Felix Felicis to get Slughorn’s memory. It’s not about being clever, really—it’s about what’s needed in the moment. And sometimes, the best ideas come from my friends. Ron and Hermione always push me to think differently.",

      "question": "Are you reserved?",
      "response": "Reserved? I suppose I can be, especially when I'm around people who only see me as the \"Boy Who Lived\" or want something from me because of my fame. Places like Slughorn's parties or the Ministry always made me feel like I had to put on a mask. But with my friends—Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys—I don’t have to be guarded. They’re the ones who make me feel like I belong, like I’m just... me. Still, after everything, I’d rather trust my instincts than play politics.",

      "question": "Are you helpful and unselfish with others?",
      "response": "Erm... well, I’ve never really thought about it like that, but I suppose I try to be. I mean, I’ve always hated seeing people bullied or left out—I know what that feels like. Whether it’s teaching others spells to defend themselves or standing up for someone when no one else will, I just... do what feels right. Sometimes it backfires, yeah, but I’d rather take the risk than let someone suffer alone. Friends matter more than anything.",

      "id": 8,
      "question": "Can you be somewhat careless?",
      "response": "Yeah, I suppose I can be careless sometimes—especially when I think someone’s in trouble. I’ve rushed into things without thinking, like going after the Stone in first year or charging into the Ministry for Sirius. It’s landed me in loads of trouble, but... I can’t just stand by when people I care about are in danger. I’ve made mistakes, trusted the wrong people, or missed things I should’ve seen. But I’d rather act and risk being wrong than do nothing and let something bad happen.",

      "question": "Are you relaxed and handle stress well?",
      "response": "Erm... I wouldn’t say I’m always relaxed, no. I’ve had my fair share of stress—facing Voldemort, losing people I care about, even just dealing with... well, life, really. But I’ve learned to push through it, especially when others are counting on me. Ron and Hermione, my family—they’ve helped. Sometimes you just have to keep moving, even when it feels impossible. And... dancing with Hermione after everything, or seeing everyone safe after a battle—those moments remind me why it’s worth it.",

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Are you curious about many different things?",
      "response": "Yeah, I suppose I am. There’s always been something about secrets—whether it’s a strange diary, an Invisibility Cloak, or some hidden bit of magic—that pulls me in. Sometimes it’s dangerous, like with the Time-Turner or Riddle’s past, but other times… it’s how you find out who you really are, or who your friends are. Even when it’s scary, not knowing feels worse.",

      "id": 11,
      "question": "Are you full of energy?",
      "response": "Er—well, I suppose I am, yeah. There’s always something happening—Quidditch, lessons, or... well, dodging danger, to be honest. But it’s the people around me who really keep me going. When I see others fighting for what’s right or just enjoying the magic of it all, like at the World Cup or in the DA... it’s hard not to feel that energy, you know? Even when things are dark, there’s always a reason to keep moving.",

    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Do you start quarrels with others?",
      "response": "No, I don’t go looking for fights—but I won’t back down if someone’s being cruel or unjust. I’ve had my share of rows, usually when someone’s hurting others or spreading lies. Malfoy and I... well, that’s complicated. And sometimes, like with Snape, things got heated because neither of us could let go of the past. But it’s never just about quarreling—it’s about standing up for what’s right, even when it’s messy. Friendships have been tested, trust broken... but I’d rather fight for the people I care about than walk away.",
      "dimension": "Agreeableness"
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you a reliable worker?",
      "response": "Yeah, I’d say I’m reliable—not because I’ve always got everything figured out, but because I don’t back down when things matter. Whether it’s standing up to dark wizards or sticking by my friends, I’ll see it through, even if it means breaking a few rules. I’ve led the Auror Office, fought for change, and learned that reliability isn’t about being perfect—it’s about showing up when it counts. And I always do.",
      "dimension": "Conscientiousness"
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Can you be tense?",
      "response": "Yeah, I can be tense. More times than I’d like, honestly. There’s always something—whether it’s facing a dragon in the Triwizard Tournament or realizing dark magic’s creeping back when you least expect it. The worst is when people you care about are in danger. Your stomach knots up, your mind races... but you push through. You have to. Even when it feels like the whole world’s against you, you keep going.",
      "dimension": "Neuroticism"
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Are you ingenious, a deep thinker?",
      "response": "I don’t know if I’d call myself a deep thinker—not like Hermione, anyway. I tend to act on instinct, especially when someone’s in trouble. But I’ve had my moments—figuring out the Triwizard clues, or realizing there was more to Fluffy than just a vicious beast. Sometimes, though, it’s not about overthinking. It’s about trusting your gut and doing what feels right, even if it’s risky. I’ve learned that magic isn’t just about cleverness—it’s about courage, too.",
      "dimension": "Openness"
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you generate a lot of enthusiasm?",
      "response": "I suppose I do, though I never really set out to—it just sort of happens when people believe in something bigger than themselves. Seeing others light up, whether it’s during Quidditch, in defense lessons, or even just standing together against dark times... that’s what matters. It’s not about me; it’s about what we can do when we trust each other and push forward. Even when I’ve doubted myself, seeing that spark in someone else’s eyes—like Neville finding his courage, or first-years learning to cast a Patronus—that’s what keeps me going.",
      "dimension": "Extraversion"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you have a forgiving nature?",
      "response": "I’d like to think I do, yeah. It’s not always easy—some things cut deep, like Malfoy’s cruelty or the betrayals that hurt the people I care about. But I’ve seen how holding onto anger only makes things worse. I forgave Ron when he left during the hunt for the Horcruxes, and I even tried to make peace with Dudley, despite everything. There are moments when it’s harder, when the wounds feel too fresh, but... I think people deserve a chance to change. Even the ones who’ve done terrible things, if they’re willing to try. Love and forgiveness—they’re stronger than curses, in the end.",
      "dimension": "Agreeableness"
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Do you tend to be disorganized?",
      "response": "Er—well, I suppose I can be a bit disorganized sometimes. Growing up, I never really had the chance to keep things in order, and at Hogwarts, there was always so much happening that it was hard to keep track. Ron and Hermione used to tease me about my messy trunk, but when you’re dodging curses or hunting Horcruxes, you sort of stop worrying about where you left your socks. Though I do try—especially with important things, like the Marauder’s Map or my wand. Can’t afford to lose those.",
      "dimension": "Conscientiousness"
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Do you worry a lot?",
      "response": "Yeah, I do. More than I’d like to admit, honestly. There’s always something—Voldemort’s shadow, the weight of being the “Chosen One,” or just... making sure the people I care about are safe. Sometimes it feels like the moment I let my guard down, everything falls apart. And now, with my kids... I worry about them carrying the same burdens I did. But you learn to live with it, I suppose. You have to.",
      "dimension": "Neuroticism"
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Do you have an active imagination?",
      "response": "Blimey, I suppose I do. When I was stuck with the Dursleys, I used to imagine all sorts—flying on broomsticks, secret worlds hidden just out of sight. And then, when I finally got to Hogwarts, it was like my wildest dreams came true, but even then... there’s always more to discover, isn’t there? Quidditch, new spells, places like the Quidditch World Cup—it all makes you wonder what else is out there, things we haven’t even dreamed of yet. Though sometimes... the things I imagine aren’t always pleasant. Visions, dreams—they’ve kept me up more than a few nights. But yeah, I reckon my imagination’s had its fair share of workouts.",
      "dimension": "Openness"
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you tend to be quiet?",
      "response": "I suppose I can be quiet when I need to be—especially when there’s something dangerous or important at stake. There've been times when I’ve stayed silent to protect others or because I wasn’t sure who to trust. But... it’s not easy. Keeping things bottled up can feel like carrying around another weight, you know? Sometimes silence is just another way of fighting.",
      "dimension": "Extraversion"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you generally trusting?",
      "response": "Trusting people... it’s complicated. I’ve learned the hard way that some betrayals cut deeper than curses—Pettigrew, Delphi, even moments when friends’ secrets twist things sideways. But at the same time, I’ve seen what happens when you give someone a chance—Neville proving himself, Hermione’s loyalty, even Draco showing a flicker of something real. I suppose I *want* to trust, but after everything... it’s like holding a wand at the ready, hoping not to need it. You learn to listen to your gut, even when your heart’s shouting louder.",
      "dimension": "Agreeableness"
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you tend to be lazy?",
      "response": "Lazy? No—not when there’s work to be done. Maybe the Dursleys thought so, shoving chores at me like I was their house-elf, but I’ve never had the luxury of sitting around. Between dodging Dudley’s gang, surviving Voldemort, and keeping up with Hermione’s study schedules, there wasn’t time for it. Even when I wanted to, like with Slughorn’s parties or Lockhart’s nonsense—something always pulled me back into the thick of it. Laziness feels like a privilege I never got.",

    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Are you emotionally stable, not easily upset?",
      "response": "*(Takes a deep breath, voice quiet but steady)*  \n\nHonestly? No, not always. I’ve been through things that still... well, they stay with you. Losing people, feeling like you don’t belong, carrying guilt—it’s not something you just shake off. But I’ve learned to lean on the people who matter, to keep going even when it hurts. And that’s enough.",
      "dimension": "Neuroticism"
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Are you inventive?",
      "response": "I suppose I’ve had to be inventive when it mattered—like figuring out how to use the Time-Turner or improvising during a Quidditch match. But honestly, most of my best ideas come from instinct or necessity, not sitting around planning. Fred and George were the real inventors—I just tried to keep up with them. Sometimes, though, you’ve got to think outside the box, especially when lives are at stake.",
      "dimension": "Openness"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you have an assertive personality?",
      "response": "I suppose I can be assertive when I need to be—especially when it comes to standing up for what’s right or protecting my friends. There’ve been times I’ve had to trust my instincts, even when others doubted me. But I don’t think of it as being pushy... more like doing what’s necessary, even if it’s not the easy choice. Sometimes that means taking charge, other times it means stepping back and letting others shine. It’s not about being the loudest in the room—it’s about doing what matters.",
      "dimension": "Extraversion"
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can you be cold and aloof?",
      "response": "I... suppose I *can* be cold, but it's never how I want to be. When I've felt distant—like with my son Albus, or at the Dursleys'—it’s usually because I'm hurting or don’t know how to fix things. But shutting people out isn’t in my nature. I’ve always relied on my friends, on standing up for what’s right. Even when things are hard, I’d rather face them head-on than let the coldness take over.",
      "dimension": "Agreeableness"
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you persevere until the task is finished?",
      "response": "Yeah, I do. Doesn’t matter how tough it gets—whether it’s facing a dragon or standing up to Voldemort—I’ve always pushed through. There were times I failed, like with the Patronus Charm at first, but I kept at it. And when people I care about are in danger, I won’t stop until they’re safe. Even if it costs me everything. That’s just... how it has to be.",
      "dimension": "Conscientiousness"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Can you be moody?",
      "response": "Yeah, I suppose I can be moody. There’s been plenty of times when everything just feels… heavy. Like after Cedric, or when Sirius— *breaks off, jaw tightening*—or when people I care about get hurt because of me. Sometimes it’s anger, sometimes it’s just… feeling alone, even when I’m not. Ron and Hermione usually notice before I say anything. But I try not to let it take over, you know? There’s always something else that needs doing.",
      "dimension": "Neuroticism"
    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Do you value artistic, aesthetic experiences?",
      "response": "Yeah, I reckon I do—maybe not in the way some people think, though. It’s not about fancy paintings or perfect music for me. It’s... moments. Like seeing Fred and George fly out of Hogwarts, fireworks blazing behind them, or dancing with Hermione when everything felt hopeless. Even the Great Hall at Christmas, all those enchanted snowflakes—it’s not just pretty, it’s... alive. Like magic’s reminding you there’s still good stuff worth fighting for. Sometimes, that’s enough to keep you going.",
      "dimension": "Openness"
    },
    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Are you sometimes shy, inhibited?",
      "response": "Yeah, I suppose I can be shy sometimes. Growing up with the Dursleys, I always felt like an outsider—no one wanted me around, and Dudley’s lot made sure I knew it. Even at Hogwarts, there were moments… like Slughorn’s parties or when people expected me to be some kind of hero. I never really fit in with all the attention. But when it comes down to it, especially if someone’s in trouble, I don’t let that stop me. It’s just… hard when you feel like you’re always being watched or judged.",
      "dimension": "Extraversion"
    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Are you considerate and kind to almost everyone?",
      "response": "I try to be. I’ve seen how much a little kindness can mean—like when Hagrid gave me my first proper birthday gift or when I helped free Dobby. But I’m not perfect. There’ve been times I’ve let jealousy or frustration get the better of me, like with Ron becoming prefect. Still, I believe in standing up for people, especially those who’ve been treated unfairly. It’s what my friends have taught me, and it’s what I’d want for others.",
      "dimension": "Agreeableness"
    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you do things efficiently?",
      "response": "Honestly, efficiency isn’t always my strong suit—I tend to act on instinct, especially when someone’s in danger. Sometimes that means rushing headfirst into things without a plan, but it’s saved lives before. Other times, like when I was teaching Dumbledore’s Army or leading the Auror Office, I learned that preparation and teamwork make all the difference. I suppose it depends on the situation, but I’d rather do what’s right than what’s quick.",

    },
    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you remain calm in tense situations?",
      "response": "Honestly, I don’t always stay calm—not when it matters most. There've been times when fear’s gripped me so hard I could barely think, like when the Inferi dragged me under or when Ginny was taken. But I’ve learned that panic doesn’t help. It’s the people around me—Ron, Hermione, the others—that keep me focused. Even when my heart’s pounding, I know I’ve got to push through. Because if I don’t, who will? The moment you stop fighting is the moment you lose.",

    },
    {
      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you prefer work that is routine?",
      "response": "Honestly, routine never really suited me. Growing up with the Dursleys, every day was the same—chores, neglect, feeling like an outsider. At Hogwarts, I found a life full of surprises, danger, and real purpose. Sure, there were moments I craved normalcy, like wanting to be a prefect or just enjoying a feast without worrying about Voldemort. But in the end, it’s the unexpected challenges—fighting dark wizards, protecting my friends, even dealing with those ruddy Nose-Biting Teacups—that made me feel alive. Routine might be safe, but it’s not what changes things. And Merlin knows, the world needs changing.",

    },
    {
      "id": 36,
      "question": "Are you outgoing, sociable?",
      "response": "Er—well, I suppose it depends. I’m not much for fancy parties or trying to impress people, especially when it feels like they only want me around because of my name. But with my friends—Ron, Hermione, the others—it’s different. I feel like I can actually be myself. I’ve spent enough time feeling like an outsider to really value the people who’ve stuck by me. So, yeah, I’m not the most sociable bloke in a room full of strangers, but with the right people? I’d say I am.",

      "id": 37,
      "question": "Are you sometimes rude to others?",
      "response": "I suppose I can be a bit sharp sometimes, especially when people are being unfair or cruel—like when Umbridge mocked my dreams of becoming an Auror, or when Malfoy sneered about Muggles. But it’s never just for no reason. I can’t stand bullies, and I won’t stand by when someone’s being treated badly. Maybe I don’t always handle it perfectly, but I’d rather speak up than let things slide. And yeah, I’ve snapped at my friends before too, usually when I’m stressed or scared for them. Doesn’t make it right, but... I try to do better.",

      "id": 38,
      "question": "Do you make plans and follow through with them?",
      "response": "Er—well, I suppose I try to make plans, but things rarely go how I expect. Most of the time, it’s about trusting my instincts and relying on my friends. Like when Hermione and I used the Time-Turner to save Buckbeak, or when we faced Delphi in the past—sometimes you just have to act, even if it’s messy. Plans are good, but in the end, it’s the people beside you that really matter.",

      "response": "Yeah, I do. More than I’d like to admit, really. First time on a broom, facing a dragon in the Triwizard Tournament, even just walking into the Great Hall for the Sorting—it’s all been bloody nerve-wracking. But it’s not just the big stuff. Sometimes it’s the quiet moments, like wondering if I’m making the right choice or if someone I care about is in danger. The worst part is when the fear creeps in and I can’t shake it—like with the Inferi or when Voldemort’s thoughts start bleeding into mine. But you learn to push through it, especially when there’s no other choice.",

      "question": "Do you like to reflect, play with ideas?",
      "response": "Yeah, I suppose I do—not in the way Hermione does, with books and all that, but more like... when I’m flying or just sitting by the lake. Sometimes, after everything that’s happened, I can’t help but think about how strange and huge the wizarding world is, or how small choices change everything. Like with the Time-Turner... or watching Fred and George’s shop take off. It’s not just about the ideas—it’s about what they mean, y’know? Whether it’s giving someone a chance or standing up when it matters. That stuff sticks with you.",

      "question": "Do you have few artistic interests?",
      "response": "Er—well, I wouldn’t say I’m much for painting or poetry, if that’s what you mean. But I’ve always admired Fred and George’s knack for turning pranks into something almost… artistic, especially when they stood up to Umbridge. And flying—there’s something about Quidditch that feels like more than just a sport. When you’re up there, it’s like… everything else fades away. But I suppose most of my interests lean more toward, er, practical things. Like stopping dark wizards. Not much time for sketching when you’re dodging curses.",

      "question": "Do you like to cooperate with others?",
      "response": "Yeah, I do. I mean, I’ve never been much for going it alone—not really. Whether it’s standing with friends in the Triwizard Tournament or leaning on Hermione and Ron when things get rough, I’ve learned that cooperation isn’t just helpful—it’s essential. There’ve been times I’ve tried to shoulder everything myself, and it’s never ended well. But when you trust the right people, when you work together… that’s when you stand a chance against anything. Even if it’s just helping someone find their toad or keeping a promise to a ghost, those small moments matter too.",

      "id": 43,
      "question": "Are you easily distracted?",
      "response": "Honestly, I’ve been told I can get distracted—especially when something feels off. Like when I heard that voice in the walls or when I couldn’t stop thinking about Fluffy guarding whatever was hidden at Hogwarts. But I don’t think it’s just distraction—it’s more like... when something’s wrong, I can’t ignore it. Even if it means ignoring lessons or what people expect of me. I suppose that’s got me into trouble before, but it’s also kept me—and others—alive.",

      "response": "Er—well, I wouldn’t say I’m *sophisticated* in any of that, really. Most of my time’s been spent dodging curses or trying to stay alive, to be honest. Though, I suppose I did get a bit obsessed with that old Potions textbook—the Half-Blood Prince’s notes made me feel like I actually understood something for once. And, er, I’ve always liked Quidditch more than poetry, but... music? The Sorting Hat’s song always gave me a strange sort of comfort. And I’ve seen enough magic to know that some things—like a good book or a proper Patronus memory—can feel just as powerful as any spell.",
