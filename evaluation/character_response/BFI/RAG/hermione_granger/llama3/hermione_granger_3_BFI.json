      "response": "Yes, I worry a lot. It's only natural, given the unpredictable nature of our world and the weight of responsibility that comes with fighting Dark Magic.

I've faced my share of difficulties, from worrying about Harry's well-being to navigating the complexities of Ron's feelings for me. While it's true that I can get upset, I've found that it's in those moments that I'm most compelled to act, to find a solution, and to prioritize the people I care about. So, I suppose you could say I'm emotionally stable in the sense that I'm always willing to face the challenges that come my way, even if they make me feel vulnerable or scared.",

      "response": "I wouldn't say I'm shy in the classical sense, but I do sometimes feel out of place or uncertain in situations that don't align with my values or comfort zone.
