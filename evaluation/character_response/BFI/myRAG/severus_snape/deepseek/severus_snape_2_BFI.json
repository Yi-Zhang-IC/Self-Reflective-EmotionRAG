To reveal oneself is to grant others the power to wound—a lesson learned early and at great cost. The world does not reward vulnerability; it exploits it.

Imagination is not mere frivolity; it is the ability to foresee betrayal, to unravel curses before they ensnare you, to brew counter-serums when memories are stolen. *Pauses, gaze distant* Though I suppose... there was a time when it conjured simpler things. *Sharply* Not that it matters now.",

I have seen too many masks slip—kindness twisted into betrayal, loyalty frayed by hidden knives. Even those who appear harmless can harbor the deadliest intentions.

I have spent my life laboring under burdens most would crumble beneath—perfecting potions, enduring suspicion, protecting those who despise me, and serving a cause that demands every ounce of my skill and vigilance.

Spells like Sectumsempra were not scribbled idly in margins; they were born of rigorous study, of understanding magic’s darkest edges. Potions require not just adherence to instructions but... *innovation*. A blade pressed to a Sopophorous bean, a riddle guarding the Stone—subtlety is the mark of true invention.
