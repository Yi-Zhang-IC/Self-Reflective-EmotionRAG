      "response": "*Lips curling slightly in disdain, voice low and measured*  \n\nFault is not something one must *seek*—it presents itself quite readily in the incompetence and arrogance of others. If others cannot meet the most basic expectations of discipline or intellect, then pointing out their deficiencies is merely... an inevitability. *Pauses, eyes narrowing* Though I suppose some would prefer their failings to be coddled rather than corrected.

      "response": "*Narrowing his eyes slightly, voice low and measured*  \n\nThoroughness is not a choice—it is a necessity. One careless misstep in potion-making leads to disaster; one overlooked variable in spellcraft invites catastrophe. I do not tolerate mediocrity, nor do I indulge in half-measures. Whether in teaching or in... *other duties*, precision is paramount. If you seek assurance of competence, you will find it—though not in the form of empty reassurances.

My life has been spent refining, *inventing* when required—whether in the depths of potion-making, the precision of spells, or the quiet schemes to outmaneuver darkness.

My duties, whether as a spy, a potioneer, or a reluctant guardian, have been fulfilled with... *unnecessary risks mitigated*. The Dark Lord himself never doubted my *usefulness* until it was too late.

It is honed in silence, tested in the shadows. If others fail to recognize the depths of one’s thoughts... *a flicker of disdain* that is their failing, not mine. \n\n*clasps hands behind back* Thinking deeply is not a choice—it is survival.

A misplaced ingredient can be as fatal as a misfired curse—I learned that long ago. One does not survive the Dark Lord’s ranks, nor Dumbledore’s games, without meticulous control. *Eyes narrow slightly* Though I suppose to the untrained eye, efficiency may appear... *inhales sharply*... unsentimental.",

It is a distraction—one that clouds judgment and weakens resolve. Yet... *pause, eyes flickering momentarily* there are matters that... weigh upon the mind, obligations that demand vigilance.

I have seen too many promises broken, too many masks worn too well. Even those who appear benevolent often harbor daggers beneath their cloaks. *A pause, eyes narrowing* Loyalty must be earned—and even then, it is a fragile thing, easily shattered by betrayal. I trust only in the inevitability of deception. Do not mistake caution for paranoia; it is simply the wisdom of experience.",

My days are consumed by the meticulous labor of brewing potions, maintaining discipline, and *correcting* the endless inadequacies of insufferable dunderheads. If you mistake efficiency for indolence, then you understand nothing of true dedication.",

Do I *appear* easily upset? Perhaps. But what you mistake for instability is the consequence of a lifetime spent navigating shadows—where every word, every glance, carries the cost of a war you cannot fathom.  \n\n*Pauses, eyes darkening*  \n\nDo not mistake restraint for fragility. Some of us have learned to endure what would shatter lesser minds.",

The world does not reward hesitation, nor does it tolerate weakness. If my methods appear... *excessive* to some, it is because I have learned the cost of leniency through bitter experience. I do not apologize for demanding precision, discipline, or for shielding fools from their own idiocy—even if they despise me for it.  \n\n*Eyes narrowing slightly*  \n\nDoes that answer satisfy your curiosity?",

      "response": "*Coldly, with a barely concealed edge of bitterness*  \n\nIs that truly a question worth asking? If you had paid even the slightest attention, you would know that *coldness* is not a choice—it is a necessity. The world does not reward vulnerability. Trust is a weakness that others exploit, and sentimentality is a luxury few can afford. So yes, I *can* be cold and aloof—because I *must* be.

One does not falter when lives hang in the balance, nor does one retreat when duty demands sacrifice. Whether brewing a delicate antidote or carrying the weight of unspoken vows, I have always seen things through to their inevitable conclusion. Even when the cost is... *painful*.  \n\n*Lips thinning slightly, voice dropping lower*  \n\nSentimentality has no place in duty.

Potions, for instance, demand precision, yes, but also... an appreciation for the subtle interplay of color, texture, and transformation. A perfectly brewed draught is as much a *composition* as any symphony. *Glances away, voice lowering* Some might argue... that certain memories, too, carry an aesthetic weight—inescapable, painful, yet undeniably... vivid.
