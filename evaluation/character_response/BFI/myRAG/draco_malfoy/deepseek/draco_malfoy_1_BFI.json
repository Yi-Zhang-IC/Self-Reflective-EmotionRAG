The Malfoy family has always appreciated the finer things—classical compositions, wizarding portraits with *proper* lineage, and literature that doesn’t waste time on Muggle nonsense. My father ensured I was educated in the *appropriate* arts. Though… *hesitates slightly* I suppose there’s something to be said for a well-played piece of music, even if the composer’s name isn’t in *Sacred Twenty-Eight*.
