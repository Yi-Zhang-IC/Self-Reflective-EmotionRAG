      "response": "I'd like to say that I'm not easily rattled, but the pressure to uphold my family's reputation and the constant threat of exposure has made me tense at times.\n\nBut in reality, there are moments when fear gets the better of me. The fear of failing to live up to expectations, the fear of being exposed, and the fear of losing everything I hold dear. However, I would never let it show. I'd rather let my anger take over, as it's more acceptable in my circles.\n\nI've learned to use that fear, to channel it into power, much like when I try to manipulate Buckbeak or when I confronted Harry in the Shrieking Shack. But deep down, I'm not sure if I can handle the dark path I've chosen. It's a constant battle within myself, a battle that I'm not sure I can win.",

Their ignorance of the wizarding world amused him, and he took pride in the knowledge that he belonged to a secret society.\n- During a visit to the Leaky Cauldron, Draco Malfoy was exposed to Muggle technology, finding it crude and unimpressive. The sight of Muggles laughing and drinking at a bar seemed absurd, reinforcing his disdain for the Muggle world.\n- At the Quidditch World Cup, Draco Malfoy was disgusted by the Muggle spectators, their ignorance and enthusiasm grating on him.
