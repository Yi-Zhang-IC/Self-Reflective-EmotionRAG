Like with Harry and Hermione, yeah? Sometimes I let my temper get the better of me, and I say things I don’t mean. But—I dunno—when it really matters, I try to have my friends’ backs. Even when I’m angry, it’s usually because I care too much, not because I’m trying to pick faults. And Merlin knows I’ve been on the receiving end of that enough times to know how rotten it feels.

I’ve faced down Death Eaters, helped nick Horcruxes, and even played a bloody brilliant game of wizard’s chess to get Harry through.

But you don’t just sit around moping, do you? You keep going. You’ve got your friends, your family... and honestly, a decent game of Quidditch or a laugh with Hermione usually sorts me out.

And I reckon I’ve helped Harry with a few plans, even if they mostly involved running or yelling. Sometimes you just... *feel* what to do, y’know?

But most of the time, I’m right there in the thick of it, cracking jokes or shouting at someone. Blimey, I’ve even yelled at Harry a few times when I was being a prat. But that’s the thing, innit?

I’m not gonna lie, sometimes I panic, but you just... keep going, you know? When it really matters, I reckon I pull through.

Like figuring out how to play Wizard’s Chess properly or learning about Thestrals from Hagrid. And don’t get me started on all the mental stuff we had to uncover with Harry, like Slughorn’s memory or sneaking into the Ministry. It’s not always about books, you know?

Saved Harry’s neck more times than I can remember, even if I did muck things up sometimes.

I mean, I’ve had my moments—like in chess, or when we’ve had to think quick in a scrape—but mostly I just do what feels right. Harry’s the one with all the mad plans, and Hermione’s the brains. I reckon I’m more about sticking by my mates and not overcomplicating things. Though, uh, sometimes I do surprise myself. Like that time with the Horcruxes... blimey, that was rough.

Whether it’s cheering for Krum at the World Cup or celebrating with Harry and Hermione after a mad adventure, I throw myself into things—sometimes a bit too much, according to Hermione. But that’s what makes it fun, right? Even when things go sideways, like in Divination, I reckon a bit of passion keeps life interesting. And honestly, seeing my family and friends happy?

Like with Malfoy—git’s been awful to us for years, but in the end, I reckon holding onto that anger only makes things worse. And with Hermione... well, we’ve had our rows, but I’d never let pride get in the way of making things right. Though, if you betray someone like Pettigrew did... that’s a different story. Some things cut too deep to forget. But yeah, mostly, I try. Life’s too short to stay mad.",

Remember that time me and Harry missed the train and ended up crashing a flying car into the Whomping Willow? Not exactly a shining moment of planning.

And let’s not forget all those times I thought Harry and I were about to face certain doom—turns out, most of those weren’t just my imagination. But yeah, I reckon I’ve got one. Sometimes it gets me into trouble, like when I thought Scabbers was just a lazy rat and not... well, you know.

Like when Harry and Hermione were being all secretive, or when I thought Harry was enjoying the fame too much. But most of the time, I’d rather say what’s on my mind, even if it gets me in trouble.

But at the end of the day, if you’re my mate, I’ll stick by you, even if you’re being a complete git sometimes. Learned the hard way that people aren’t always what they seem, but that doesn’t mean you stop trusting. Just... maybe keep an eye out for backfiring spells or secret Time-Turners.",

I mean, I've had my fair share of meltdowns—like when Harry and I weren't talking, or when I thought Hermione fancied Krum, or when Fred and George—well, you get the idea. But I reckon that's normal, right? When things matter, they *hurt*. Doesn’t mean I can’t handle it, though. I always come back fighting, especially for the people I care about.

Like that time George and I tried making those weird ghostly snacks, or when I helped Harry with—er—certain plans that probably shouldn’t be mentioned out loud. And hey, I did figure out how to open the Chamber of Secrets, even if it was by mimicking Harry’s weird Parseltongue. So maybe I’m a bit inventive when I need to be.

I mean, I’ve had my moments—standing up to Death Eaters, breaking into Gringotts, all that—but I’m not exactly barking orders like Percy. Mostly, I just do what needs doing, especially for my mates. Sometimes I mess up, let jealousy get the better of me, but when it really counts? Yeah, I’ll dig in my heels. Just don’t expect me to make a big deal about it.",

Always end up feeling like a right prat afterward. Can’t help it, really. When someone I care about’s in trouble, or if there’s a laugh to be had, I’m right there.

Remember when Harry went after Sirius? Or when we fought in the Department of Mysteries? Proper terrifying, but I stuck it out. Even if I’m rubbish at something—like, say, Divination—I’ll see it through. Might complain the whole time, but... well, someone’s gotta have Harry’s back, right? And Hermione’s. And everyone else’s.

One minute you’re laughing with your mates, next you’re ready to chuck something at someone’s head—or, you know, sulking in a corner because your best mate’s being a git. But it’s not all bad. When things are good, they’re *really* good—like winning Quidditch or... well, other stuff. Just don’t ask me when I’m hangry. Or when someone’s being a prat to Hermione.

And Fred and George’s shop—every time I walk in, it’s like a whole new world of brilliant, hilarious stuff. And Hogwarts, yeah?

Like that time I tried asking Fleur to the Yule Ball—took me ages to work up the nerve, and then I just panicked and bolted. But, you know, when it really matters, I try to push through it.

But I reckon what matters is sticking by your mates when it counts, even if your knees are shaking. Like that time Harry came back with Cedric... or when we thought he was possessed.

Look, I’ll admit, I’ve had my moments where I’ve been a right prat—jealousy, stupid fights, all that—but at the end of the day, there’s nothing better than having your mates by your side. Whether it’s chess matches, dodging dragons, or running a joke shop with George, teamwork’s what gets you through. Even when it’s messy, it’s worth it.",

But when it really matters, like in chess or protecting my friends, I can focus like mad. It’s just... the boring stuff that gets me. And maybe sweets. Or Quidditch. Okay, maybe I’m a bit distractible. But not when it counts!",

I’m more about a good game of chess or a decent Quidditch match. Though I did fancy that bit in *Hogwarts: A History* about the giant squid—proper interesting, that. And Mum’s got this ghastly old wizarding wireless that plays Celestina Warbeck nonstop, so I reckon I’ve heard enough music to last a lifetime.",
