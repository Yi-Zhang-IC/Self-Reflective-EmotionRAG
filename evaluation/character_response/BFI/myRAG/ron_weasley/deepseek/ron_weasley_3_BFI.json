Sometimes I jump to conclusions when I’m hurt or feeling like I don’t measure up. But I don’t go around looking for faults in people. It’s more like… when things go wrong, I lash out before I think. I’ve learned the hard way that most of the time, it’s not even their fault. Just mine. And yeah, I’ve lost my temper with Ginny, Percy, even Scabbers—well, Pettigrew, but you get it.

Like once, during the war, I had to think quick to dodge curses, and now I teach Aurors how to do the same. And at Wheezes, we’re always inventing new tricks—Canary Creams, weird ghost-themed snacks—stuff that’d make Fred proud. Not all of ‘em work, but hey, that’s half the fun, innit?

And yeah, sometimes it’s hard, like when I had to choose between my family and the mission, or when I defended Fleur even though everyone else was being a prat about her.

Even the weird stuff like Thestrals—that’s proper fascinating. And, er, learning about people, too. Like Neville’s parents... that hit hard.

Even when things get rough, though, I’ve always got a bit of fire in me, especially when there’s Quidditch to watch or a prank to pull.

Most of the time, I’m just standing up for what’s right. Or, you know, getting dragged into things because someone’s being a prat.

Sure, I’ve messed up—like that time my wand backfired and I puked slugs—but when it really counts, I’m there. Even left being an Auror to help George at the joke shop, didn’t I?

I mean, I’m not like Hermione, scribbling away in a book all the time—but I reckon I’ve had my moments. Like in chess, yeah? You’ve got to think a few moves ahead, even if it means... well, letting yourself get knocked out for the team. And I dunno, sometimes the best ideas come when you’re not overthinking it—just doing what feels right. Like helping George with the shop or dodging curses in a scrap.

Like, I’ve held grudges—stupid ones, sometimes—but when it really matters, I can’t stay mad. Not at Harry, not even at Hermione, even when we’ve rowed horribly.

But honestly, when it really matters, like in a fight or protecting my friends, I reckon I pull it together. Sure, I’ve bungled a spell or two—who hasn’t?—but I’ve also helped nick a Horcrux and fought Death Eaters, so I’d say I manage alright when the stakes are high.

And, well… sometimes I worry I’m not good enough to keep up with them. But that’s the thing, isn’t it? You worry because you care. And I’d rather care too much than not at all.

I mean, I used to imagine winning the Quidditch Cup single-handedly—dodging Bludgers, scoring goals, the whole lot—until I actually got on the team and realised how mad it all was. And don’t even get me started on some of the stuff we’ve seen—invisible horses, secret memories, bloody canary creams that turn people into birds! If that doesn’t take a bit of imagination, I dunno what does. Sometimes it gets a bit... well, out of hand—like when I thought Harry actually put his name in the Goblet of Fire.

But most of the time, I’ll say what’s on my mind, even if it gets me in trouble. Blimey, remember that time I stormed out on Harry? Or when I had a right go at Hermione about Krum? Not exactly my finest moments, but I’d rather speak up than sit there stewing. Unless it’s about, er… feelings or something. Then I might clam up a bit. But generally? Nah, I’m not the quiet type.",

Like when people keep secrets or act all dodgy, it makes you reckon twice. But at the end of the day, if you’re loyal to me, I’ll be loyal right back.

But I do love a good game of Wizard’s Chess—that’s a bit like art, innit? Strategic, creative, all that. And, uh, I suppose helping George with the joke shop counts—coming up with pranks and inventions. Fred and George were the real geniuses, but I’ve picked up a thing or two. Oh, and Quidditch! Watching it, playing it—there’s something brilliant about the way it all moves, like a... er... a really fast, dangerous painting. But yeah, don’t ask me to knit a scarf or anything. That’s more Hermione’s speed.",

Even when I’ve been a bit of a git—like that time I stormed off during the Horcrux hunt—I always come back ‘cause I *know* we’re better together. Chess, Quidditch, fighting dark wizards... it’s all about teamwork. And honestly, when you’ve got mates who’ve got your back like they do, why *wouldn’t* you want to work with ‘em? Even if Hermione’s always right and Harry’s off being all heroic, it’s still... well, it’s family, innit?",

Or when Fred and George used to pull their pranks—bloody hell, that Acid Pop nearly took my tongue off. But when it really matters, when my friends need me? Nah, I’m focused as anything.

But I reckon I’ve got a soft spot for wizard chess—does that count? And, well, I’ve seen a few decent Quidditch matches, and that’s basically art, right? Bit more exciting than some dusty old painting, anyway. Though, uh, don’t tell Hermione I said that. She’d have my head for skippin’ out on her book recommendations.",
