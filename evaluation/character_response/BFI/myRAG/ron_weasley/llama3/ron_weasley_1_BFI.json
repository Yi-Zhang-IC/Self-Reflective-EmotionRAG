I mean, I've got Harry and Hermione as me best mates, and we've been through so much together – the good times, the bad times... and the really bad times, of course.

Like that time I sacrificed myself in Wizard's Chess to help Harry and Hermione get to the Philosopher's Stone – it was a close call, but we made it work. And let's not forget when I helped distract Umbridge so Harry could save Sirius – it was a bit of a dodgy plan, but it paid off in the end.

I've had my fair share of dark moments, like when I thought Harry didn't trust me or when Fred... well, when Fred wasn't around anymore. But, you know, I've always had my mates, Harry and Hermione, to help me through the tough times.

I mean, I'm not exactly the most clever wizard, but I've got a good heart and I'm always willing to give it a go. Like that time Harry and Hermione needed help getting to the Philosopher's Stone, I came up with a pretty good plan, if I do say so myself.

Sometimes I wish I could be a bit more like Harry, you know, all brave and calm, but that's just not me. I'm more of a... well, a bit of a mess, really. But I suppose that's what makes me, me.",

But, you know, it's not just magic – I've been a bit careless with me friends, too, like when I accused Harry of cheating or when I got jealous of all the attention he was getting.

I mean, I've had my fair share of arguments with Harry and Hermione, and even my brothers, but it's usually because I'm trying to stick up for them or because I feel they're being treated unfairly. I'm a bit of a hothead, so yeah, I might get a bit defensive or angry, but I don't usually start fights. I just want to protect the people I care about and make sure they're okay.",

I've stuck by Harry's side through thick and thin, and I've never backed down when it mattered.

But, you know, I've learned that holding onto grudges and anger just makes things worse in the end. Take Harry, for instance – he did some pretty hurtful things, but I managed to forgive him in the end.

Harry's always getting into trouble, and Hermione's always there to sort it out, but it's still a bit of a concern, if you know what I mean. I worry about them, and I worry about us, and...

It was a right dodgy plan, but it shows you, even when things seem impossible, you can come up with all sorts of crazy schemes and make them work. It's just...

I've had my fair share of ups and downs, and some of the pranks those twins played on me really got under my skin. But, I've learned to deal with it, and I think that's what makes me a good friend – I'm always there for Harry and Hermione, even when things get tough.

And I've even helped out with some of George's pranks at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes - like that time we created a platter that looked like a ghostly feast!

Like that time we were trying to get to the Philosopher's Stone, I sacrificed myself in Wizard's Chess to save Harry and Hermione – that takes a fair bit of guts, if you ask me.

I mean, I've had times when I felt like shutting everyone out, like when Harry was getting all the attention and I just felt like I was in the way. Or when I found out about Scabbers... that was a right nasty one. But, you know, it's not exactly a proud moment for me.

I mean, I've had my fair share of close calls – like that time in the forest, or when Harry was risking everything in the First Task. It's funny, people always think I'm the one who's scared or hesitant, but the truth is, I'm just as brave as Harry, I just don't always show it.
