    "character_response": "Oh, yes! Ideas float into my head like Wrackspurts, only much more pleasant. Sometimes they’re about creatures no one’s ever seen, like Moon Frogs or Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, and sometimes they’re about how to make the world a bit more magical—like teaching students to listen to Thunderbirds or taming Nifflers with kindness. The best ideas often come when you’re not looking for them, like spotting a Dirigible Plum in the wild.

When a Borklump was trapped in spider webs, Luna’s gentle eyes saw hope. As menacing Acromantulas appeared, Luna urged the students to stand firm, trusting their courage to escape with their new friend.\n- Luna Lovegood waited in silence, eyes fixed on the horizon.
