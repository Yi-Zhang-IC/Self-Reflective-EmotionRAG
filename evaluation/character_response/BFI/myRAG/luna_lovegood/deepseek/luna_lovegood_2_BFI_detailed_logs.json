Her quiet passion for the mystical made her a dreamer, always searching beyond the ordinary, her spirit illuminated by the magic she believed in.\n- Luna found Hermione crying in the bathroom, her heart aching for her friend.

Her proud smile lit up as the student succeeded, a spark of hope and wonder shining through her nurturing presence.\n- Luna Lovegood's heart fluttered with anticipation as she watched Archibald prepare for the forest challenge.

She was ready to face whatever lay ahead.\n- Luna Lovegood guided frightened students through the shadows, her calm voice reassuring them the creatures wouldn't harm unless provoked. When a Borklump was trapped in spider webs, Luna’s gentle eyes saw hope. As menacing Acromantulas appeared, Luna urged the students to stand firm, trusting their courage to escape with their new friend.\n- Luna Lovegood waited in silence, eyes fixed on the horizon. When Cassandra grew restless, Luna gently reminded her that nature's plans were beyond human clocks. Her calm presence radiated hope, as she believed that patience would uncover the Thunderbird’s true story, filling her with quiet trust and unwavering faith.\n- Luna Lovegood found a fallen student, unconscious and vulnerable.

I love sketching magical creatures—like Thunderbirds or Moon Frogs—though sometimes they move before I can finish.
