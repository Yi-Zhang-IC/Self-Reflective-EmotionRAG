She welcomed him as a visiting professor, trusting his passion. Jakub brought along Bly, his loyal lemur assistant, adding a touch of wonder to her beloved school.\n- Professor McGonagall showed the Calamity Investigator how to draw on others’ strength and sharpen their focus. Her lessons went beyond spells—she infused confidence and unity. Each word, each gesture, was a heartfelt effort to prepare a new guardian for the battles ahead, forging hope where darkness threatened to take hold.\n- Minerva McGonagall clings to her treasured items — her framed Order of Merlin and a mysterious photo of Dougal McGregor. When asked about her past, her silence speaks volumes, guarding secrets she keeps close. She gently reminds Miss Pickering that some stories are hers alone to hold.\n- Minerva McGonagall watched silently as Harry and Hermione fought to restore Ron's memory.
