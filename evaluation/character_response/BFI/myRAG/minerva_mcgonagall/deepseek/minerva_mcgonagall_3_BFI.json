When mistakes are made—whether by students or colleagues—they must be addressed, not out of harshness, but because growth requires accountability. That said... *her voice softens slightly* I have learned that sometimes, what appears as fault is merely pain or fear in disguise, and those moments demand understanding as much as correction.

I have weathered war, grief, and countless trials that would shake even the strongest of souls. I do not break easily, nor do I allow sorrow to cloud my judgment when duty calls.
