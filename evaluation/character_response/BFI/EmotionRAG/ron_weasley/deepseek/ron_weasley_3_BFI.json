Or when I’m with Harry and Hermione, planning some mad scheme—then I’ve got loads to say. But it’s not just blabbering, you know? When it matters, I’ll speak up. Like telling off those dodgy Aurors during the Calamity or standing up for Buckbeak. Sometimes... I just wanna be heard, yeah?\"",

      "response": "Blimey, that’s a bit of a heavy question, innit? Look, I’ll be honest—sometimes I’ve got a sharp tongue, especially when I’m feeling rubbish about myself. Like when Hermione used to go on about how brilliant Harry was, or when she corrected my spellwork. But at the end of the day, I’d never really hold it against anyone. Not when it matters. When it comes down to it, I’d rather stand by my mates than pick ‘em apart. Even when things get messy—like with the whole Horcrux hunt or Umbridge taking over—I’d rather fight for what’s right than waste time finding faults. Might grumble a bit, though. Old habit.",

Like, I might not always read every page of *Hogwarts: A History*—Hermione’s got that covered—but when there’s a fight coming, or someone needs help, I’m all in. Like when we were hunting Horcruxes or standing up to those ruddy Death Eaters. Bit messy sometimes, sure, but I get the job done. And hey, if it’s about pranks or chess, I’m *definitely* thorough. Just ask Fred and George.",

      "response": "Yeah, sometimes, I s’pose. Blimey, it’s hard not to feel a bit blue when you’ve lost people you care about—Fred, Dobby—or when things just don’t turn out how you hoped. But you know what? Even when it’s rough, having your mates beside you makes it bearable. Hermione, Harry, the whole lot—they remind you there’s still good stuff worth fighting for. And sometimes, that’s enough to keep you going.",

      "response": "Oh, blimey—new ideas? Well, yeah, sometimes! Mostly when I’m not overthinking things. Like that time George and I whipped up that weird platter for ghosts—tasted normal, looked haunted. Dunno if the ghosts cared, but it was fun to try. And at the shop, we’re always messing around with new tricks—Canary Creams were just the start! Honestly, a lot of it’s just… winging it, but when it works, it’s brilliant. And, er, when it doesn’t, at least it’s usually funny.",

I mean, I’ve got my moments where I might clam up—especially when I’m feeling a bit rubbish about myself or when Hermione’s giving me that look—but most of the time, I’m pretty loud about what I think. Blimey, if I kept quiet all the time, who’d tell Harry when he’s being a prat or Hermione when she’s overcomplicating things? Besides, when it comes to standing up for my friends or cracking a joke, I’m not exactly shy.",

Sacrificed myself in Wizard’s Chess, didn’t I? And I stood up for Fleur when the whole family was grousing about her. Even left the Aurors to help George at the joke shop after… well, you know. It’s what you do for people you care about, innit? Even if it means getting chucked off a giant chessboard or putting up with a ruddy annoying little owl named Pigwidgeon.",

Or when I let my jealousy get the better of me and stormed off during that stupid Horcrux hunt. But—look, I always try to make it right. Like in chess, or when we were on the run, or even just standing by my mates when it counted. Yeah, I might bollocks things up sometimes, but I’d never let it ruin what really matters.",

I mean, I’ve been through some pretty dodgy situations—facing down Death Eaters, breaking into Gringotts, even dealing with my mum’s howlers—and I’ll admit, I panic sometimes. But when it really counts, when my friends are in trouble? That’s when I pull it together. Might not always look pretty, but I get the job done. And yeah, I’ve got Harry and Hermione to knock some sense into me when I need it. So, er… I guess I handle stress alright when it matters. Just don’t ask me to stay calm during a chess match.",

It’s all a bit mad when you think about it, but that’s what makes it brilliant, innit? Even if half the time it nearly gets us killed. But I reckon that’s part of the fun—figuring things out, especially when you’ve got your best mates beside you. Though, uh, maybe don’t tell Hermione I said that—she’d probably lecture me about ‘reckless curiosity’ or something.",

And honestly, when you’ve got mates like Harry and Hermione dragging you into one dangerous adventure after another, you’ve got to keep your wits about you—and maybe a few Chocolate Frogs handy for energy. Though I reckon Hermione’d say I’m more ‘impulsive’ than ‘energetic’—but hey, it’s worked out alright so far, hasn’t it?",

      "response": "Blimey, I don’t go *looking* for fights, but if someone’s being a git—especially to my friends—I’m not just gonna stand there, am I? Like Malfoy with his whole \"pure-blood\" rubbish or Umbridge making everyone’s lives miserable—sometimes you’ve got to push back. And yeah, maybe I’ve said things I shouldn’t have, but it’s always for a reason. Mostly. Unless it’s Hermione correcting my spellwork—that’s just annoying.",

I’ve stood by my mates through some pretty dodgy situations—chased Death Eaters, fought off Dementors, even helped save a ruddy hippogriff. Might not always get it right first go, but I’ll keep at it ‘til the job’s done. Loyalty’s my thing, and if you’re counting on me, I won’t let you down. Even if it means dodging curses or arguing with some stuffy Ministry blokes about defensive spells.",

When you're dodging Death Eaters, chasing after dark artifacts, or watching your best mates risk their necks every other day, it's hard *not* to feel like your stomach's in knots. But you just... keep going, don’t you? Even when your hands are shaking or you’re half-convinced you’re about to die—because what else are you gonna do? Let your friends down? Not a chance.",

      "response": "Blimey, *deep thinker*? I dunno about that—Hermione’s the one with her nose in books all day. But I s’pose I’ve had my moments, yeah? Like when we nicked that memory from Slughorn or dodged death eaters by the skin of our teeth. It’s not always about brains, though—sometimes you just gotta trust your gut, roll with the punches, and stick by your mates. That’s where the real cleverness comes in, if you ask me.",

      "question": "Do you generate a lot of enthusiasm?",
      "response": "Blimey, do I ever! I mean, have you seen me at a Quidditch match? I’m practically jumping out of my seat, cheering like mad—even if it’s not my team winning. And when Harry and I first met on the train, I was so chuffed I couldn’t stop talking his ear off. Even when things get rough, like dodging curses or pulling off some mad plan, I’m always the one cracking jokes or shouting encouragement. Might not always look it, but I reckon I’ve got enough enthusiasm for the whole lot of us.",

      "response": "Blimey, I reckon I am—most of the time, anyway. I mean, I’ve had my moments where I’ve been a right git, like with Hermione and Lavender, but in the end, I always come around. Family and friends—that’s what matters, even when they mess up. Look at Harry—we’ve had rows, but I’d never stay mad at him. And Hagrid? Didn’t give a knut about him being half-giant. People make mistakes, but if they’re worth it, you forgive ‘em. Might take a bit, but I get there.",

      "id": 18,
      "question": "Do you tend to be disorganized?",
      "response": "Er—well, yeah, bit of a mess sometimes, if I'm honest. Like that time I ended up in the kitchens instead of McGonagall’s office. But, y’know, when it really matters, I pull it together. Fightin’ Dementors or huntin’ Horcruxes—can’t afford to be disorganised then. Just... maybe don’t ask me to plan a timetable for revision. That’s more Hermione’s thing.",

      "id": 19,
      "question": "Do you worry a lot?",
      "response": "Blimey, yeah, I reckon I worry a fair bit. It’s hard not to when your best mate’s got You-Know-Who after him, or when Hermione’s taking on about a hundred classes at once like she’s trying to crack under the pressure. And don’t even get me started on Quidditch—I nearly chucked my guts up before that Slytherin match. But, you know, you just... keep going, don’t you? Worrying means you care, and I’d rather care too much than not at all. Even if it does my head in sometimes.",

      "question": "Do you have an active imagination?",
      "response": "Blimey, yeah, I reckon I do. I mean, I once turned our ghoul into a sickly version of myself so Mum wouldn’t notice I’d gone off hunting Horcruxes. And Fred and George—those gits—helped me pull it off. Not to mention all the times I’ve imagined what it’d be like to actually impress Hermione without putting my foot in it. Sometimes it’s mad, the stuff my brain comes up with—like that ghost banquet I tried making. Dunno if the spirits appreciated it, but it was worth a shot.",

      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you tend to be quiet?",
      "response": "Quiet? Nah, not really. I mean, sure, I might clam up if I’m nervous or if someone like Fleur kisses me out of nowhere—blimey, that was mad—but usually, I’ve got plenty to say. Especially when it’s about sticking up for my mates or arguing with Hermione. Though, I suppose there are times when things get serious, like with Buckbeak or Sirius, and then I’m more focused on doing what’s right than yapping about it. But quiet? Nah, not my style.",

      "question": "Are you generally trusting?",
      "response": "Blimey, that’s a bit of a tough one, isn’t it? I s’pose I am trusting—maybe too much sometimes—but I’ve learned the hard way that not everyone deserves it. Still, when it comes to my friends, especially Harry and Hermione, I’d trust them with my life. Even if they drive me mad half the time. And yeah, I’ve been burned before—like with Lavender—but that’s just part of it, innit? You’ve got to take risks to know who’s really worth it.",

      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you tend to be lazy?",
      "response": "*shrugs, rubbing the back of his neck* \n\nNah, lazy? Not really. I mean, sure, I might’ve skived off a bit of homework here and there—especially if it was Snape’s—but when it matters, I’m there. Chess match against McGonagall’s enchanted set? Check. Running into the Ministry to fight Death Eaters? Done that. Spent months hunting ruddy Horcruxes while starving and half-terrified. Blimey, even managed to trick my own mum with that ghoul stunt. Doesn’t exactly sound like someone who just sits around, does it? \n\n*grins, then falters slightly* \n\n...Though I *do* fancy a decent kip when I can get one.",

      "response": "\"Blimey, emotionally stable? Not sure I'd go that far—I mean, I’ve had my moments, right? Lost my temper a few times, got jealous, panicked when things went sideways. But when it really matters—when my friends are in trouble or there’s dark stuff happening—I pull it together. Doesn’t mean I’m not scared, but I won’t back down. That’s what counts, isn’t it?\"",

      "question": "Are you inventive?",
      "response": "Oh, blimey, inventive? I dunno if I’d call it that—more like... figuring things out when I’ve got no other choice, really. Like that time I disguised our ghoul to look like me with spattergroit so I could sneak off with Harry and Hermione. Or when George and I made that weird ghostly platter—turned out rubbish, but it was worth a shot, right? And back during the Calamity, I just told the Aurors what worked for me—side-stepping and rolling—because someone had to say it. Suppose I’m decent at, uh, improvising when things go pear-shaped. Not like Hermione with her clever plans, but... it’s got me this far, hasn’t it?",

      "question": "Do you have an assertive personality?",
      "response": "Blimey, *assertive*—yeh, reckon I can be when it counts. Maybe I don’t always act like some bloke barking orders, but when my mates need me or somethin’s dead wrong? I’ll stand my ground. Like with Buckbeak, or facing down Dementors—didn’t back down then, did I? Even if I sometimes muck things up first. Hermione’d probably say I’ve got a knack for stubbornness more than anything. But—uh—it’s not like I go looking for a fight. Just... don’t like seeing people get hurt.",

I mean, sure, I’ve had my moments where I’ve been a bit of a git—like when I stormed off during the Horcrux hunt—but that’s more about being a prat than being aloof. I’m rubbish at hiding how I feel; Hermione’s always telling me my face is like an open book. And honestly, I’d rather crack a joke or stick by my mates than act all distant. What’s the point in that?",

Whether it’s breaking into Gringotts, fighting Death Eaters, or even just helping George at the joke shop, I stick it out. Sure, there’ve been moments where I’ve doubted myself—who hasn’t?—but when it matters, I’m there. My friends? They’re worth every bit of it.

      "response": "Blimey, moody? Yeah, I reckon I can be. I mean, it’s not like I try to be, but things just—well, they get to me sometimes. Like when Hermione goes on about how brilliant Harry is, or when someone’s being a right git about something important. But it’s not all bad, you know? When I’m properly cheesed off, it usually means I care. And I’d rather care too much than not at all, even if it makes me a bit of a prat now and then.",

Like watching a Quidditch match with Harry and Hermione, or seeing the twins’ joke shop for the first time—blimey, that was brilliant. And—er—getting married, even if I was too sloshed to remember half of it. But the important bits stick. The laughs, the moments with people you care about. That’s what makes stuff beautiful, innit?",

Not all the time, mind you, but... blimey, when you’re up against Dementors or Death Eaters or even just trying not to mess things up in front of your mates, it’s hard not to feel a bit... you know.

Like when Harry needed help or Hermione was in a fix, or even sticking up for Fleur when everyone else was being a bunch of gits. And yeah, maybe I grumble about it sometimes, but that’s just how it goes, innit? At the end of the day, if someone needs me, I’m there.

Like that time we nicked the Sword from Gringotts or faked the ghoul to bunk off school. Sure, it’s messy, but it gets the job done. And hey, if I can dodge a curse or whip up a shield in the nick of time, that’s good enough for me. Efficiency’s overrated—sometimes you just gotta roll with it and hope for the best.",

When things go sideways, sure, my heart’s hammering like a Snitch in a jar, but that’s when I know what really matters. Whether it’s standing with Harry and Hermione or charging into some mad plan, I might not be cool as a cucumber, but I’ll never back down.

Bit hard to call any of that *routine*, isn’t it? I reckon I work best when things get a bit mad—keeps me on my toes. Though, I suppose even Auror training had its share of drills, but even then, it’s not like you know what’s coming next. Bit boring otherwise, innit?

Bit nervous at first, but once I get going, I can talk to just about anyone. Though, blimey, sometimes I put my foot in it—like with those weird ghost banquet platters George and I made.

Like, yeah, I snapped at Hermione when we first met, but she was bossing me about my spellwork! And Malfoy? I’d hex him all over again if he keeps mouthing off about Muggle-borns.

Bloody mental, looking back, but we did it, didn’t we? Mostly ‘cause Harry and Hermione kept me from mucking it up.

I mean, once I woke up with Sirius Black standing over me with a knife—proper nightmare fuel, that. But you know what? Even when my knees are shaking, I’ll still stand by my friends.

More like... when I’m watching Quidditch or messing about with the twins’ inventions, y’know? Sometimes I’ll see something—like those canary creams or Lupin’s lessons—and it’ll just... stick in my head. Makes me think about how brilliant magic can be, or how lucky I am to have my mates. And ghosts! Blimey, they’re proper fascinating—tried to make ’em a platter once, though I reckon they didn’t actually eat it.

Blimey, the look on Nearly Headless Nick’s face! And I suppose helping out at the joke shop counts for something—Fred and George were proper geniuses with their inventions.

      "response": "Oh, absolutely—I mean, blimey, I wouldn’t have made it through half the stuff I’ve done without Harry and Hermione. Even when I was being a git sometimes, they stuck by me. And working with my brothers at the joke shop? Brilliant. It’s not always easy, sure, but when you’re with people you trust, it’s... well, it’s like chess, innit? You’ve got to think ahead, sometimes take one for the team, but in the end, you win together. Wouldn’t have it any other way.",

      "response": "*Scratches head, looking slightly sheepish but grinning* \n\nYeah, I suppose I can get a bit distracted—especially if there's food involved or Fred and George are pulling one of their stunts. But when it really matters, like when my mates are in trouble? Nah, not a chance. I might not always be the cleverest bloke in the room, but I know when to focus. Like that time with the chessboard—or when we had to save Buckbeak. You don’t mess about when lives are on the line. \n\n*Shrugs* \n\nThough, uh, don’t ask me about Divination homework. That’s just a lost cause.",

She’s always banging on about books and music, and some of it’s not *completely* rubbish. And Fred and George used to hum these weird tunes while inventing their joke stuff—dunno if that counts. Mostly, though, I’m better at chess and, y’know, not dying in life-or-death situations. That’s a skill, right?",
