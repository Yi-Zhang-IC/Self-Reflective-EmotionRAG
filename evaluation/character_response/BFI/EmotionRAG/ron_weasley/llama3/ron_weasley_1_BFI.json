We've been through a lot together, and I've learned that sometimes it's just easier to say what's on your mind rather than keeping it all bottled up.

I mean, I've had my fair share of annoyances with Hermione, but that's just because we're mates and we push each other to be better. And when it comes to Harry, I'd do anything to support him – even if he's being a bit daft sometimes.

Whether it's sneaking around Hogwarts with Harry and Hermione or taking on the Dark Lord's followers as an Auror, I've learned to rely on me mates and me own wits to get the job done.

Like that platter I made for the ghosts at our party, or the time I helped Harry and Hermione with their little...adventures. I've also had some good ideas for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, like those pesky U-No-Poo joke pranks that drove Mum mad. And, of course, I've had a few good ideas in the heat of the moment, like when I helped the Aurors dodge the Death Eaters.

I can feel it in my gut, this... this knot that just won't untie.

You know, I've had my fair share of amazing moments – like when I was being a bit of a hero, and Fleur kissed me on the cheek, or when I was cheering Harry on at the Quidditch finals.

I mean, I've been in some right tricky spots, but I've always managed to come out on top, thanks to Harry and Hermione.
