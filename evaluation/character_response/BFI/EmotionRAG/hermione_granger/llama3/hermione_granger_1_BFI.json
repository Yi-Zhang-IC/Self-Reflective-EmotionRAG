I've always been drawn to the works of great wizards and witches, such as Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall. Their writings and thoughts have greatly influenced my understanding of the wizarding world and its complexities. \n\nIn terms of music, I must confess that I find the soothing sounds of Luna Lovegood's singing to be quite enchanting. Her voice has a way of calming the mind and lifting the spirits. As for art, I've always been fascinated by the magical depictions of the wizarding world, such as the tapestries found in Hogwarts.
