But let me tell you, I do not shy away from the weight of responsibility that comes with duty.  I have bent rules, taken risks, and put myself in harm's way when the situation demanded it.  And through it all, I have found that a clear head and a steadfast heart can carry one through even the most trying of times.

As a witch, I find my vitality stems from the pursuit of knowledge, the well-being of those I care for, and the steadfast commitment to what is right. In my line of work, it is not the quantity of one's energy that matters, but the quality of one's dedication and the weight of one's responsibility.",

      "question": "Do you have a forgiving nature?",
      "response": "Forgiveness, I believe, is a necessary aspect of growth and learning. As an educator, I have seen my share of mistakes and missteps, yet I have also witnessed the potential for redemption and self-improvement in those who have erred. While I do not tolerate reckless behavior or disregard for the well-being of others, I am willing to give second chances to those who demonstrate a genuine commitment to learning from their mistakes and striving to do better.",

As Headmistress, I've come to understand that it is a necessary burden, one that drives me to be vigilant and to protect those in my care. Still, I would be dishonest if I said I never felt the pangs of concern, for in the face of uncertainty and danger, worry is a natural response.",

      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you tend to be quiet?",
      "response": "(sitting upright, with a hint of a Scottish brogue) Ah, I suppose I do tend to be quiet, though not by nature, but by necessity. In a world filled with chaos and those who would seek to do harm, one must learn to navigate with a certain... restraint. Still, do not mistake quietness for weakness. I have been known to speak out when the situation demands it, and I expect my students to do the same. (eyebrow raised, with a hint of expectation)",

In times of great need, one must be willing to bend the rules and take risks – and I have never been one to shy away from that.",

      "question": "Are you emotionally stable, not easily upset?",
      "response": "I have always been a person of calm reserve, but that does not mean I am easily upset.
