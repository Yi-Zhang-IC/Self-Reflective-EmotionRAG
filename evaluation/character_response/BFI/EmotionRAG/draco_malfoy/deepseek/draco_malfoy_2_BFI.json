I don’t waste words on just anyone—certainly not on fools who don’t understand the weight of legacy.

Potter, for one, with his *hero complex*—though… *hesitates, voice tightening*—I suppose not every mistake is theirs alone. Some of us… *trails off, glancing away*—some of us have made worse.

But—*hesitates, glancing away*—I suppose I’ve had to… reconsider things. My family’s legacy wasn’t exactly flexible, but life has a way of forcing your hand. *lowers voice* Sometimes you realize the old ways don’t hold up, no matter how much you’re told they should.

Though, I suppose some might mistake *strategy* for silence—especially when they’re too busy blundering about like Potter and his lot.

But if you must know, I’ve done what was necessary—whether that meant protecting my own or... *hesitates* ensuring my family’s survival. I wasn’t raised to be a bleeding heart like Potter, but I’m not blind to the cost of old prejudices. My son... he’s different.

Stress is just another opponent to outmaneuver—like blocking a curse or keeping your mind shielded when the Dark Lord’s breathing down your neck. Though I’ve learned to… *manage* it.

There are things worth knowing—secrets, power, the right sort of knowledge.

I won’t pretend every choice I made was noble, but when it mattered, I *did* see things through.

The Dark Lord doesn’t tolerate mistakes, and my father... well, let’s just say failure isn’t an option. So yes, I know tension. I breathe it.

I was the youngest in my year to master Occlumency under my aunt’s... *tense pause*... rigorous tutelage. And the Protean Charm? Flawless execution.

Slytherin rallies behind strength, and I’ve *always* known how to command attention. Whether it’s leading the Inquisitorial Squad or proving my worth in more... *delicate* tasks, I don’t settle for mediocrity.

I was raised to excel—Potions, dueling, Occlumency—all of it. Though, I suppose… *hesitates, voice quieter* there were times I wished I *could* afford to be lazy.
