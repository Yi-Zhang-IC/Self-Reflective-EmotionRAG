I wasn’t raised to entertain them, if I’m being honest. My family had… expectations.

Not that I’d admit it publicly, of course. But sometimes, even when it *is* their fault, making them look worse only reflects poorly on *you*.

All those people, noise, expectations. Not that I can’t handle it, of course. But solitude has its advantages—less pretending, less performance.
