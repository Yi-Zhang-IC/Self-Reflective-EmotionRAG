      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Making friends has never been a priority for someone of my standing. Loyalty and alliances within the Slytherin circle were always sufficient. However, as time passed, I realized the value of deeper connections, even if they come from unexpected places. My relationship with my wife and son has shown me that there's more to life than just blood purity and superficial bonds. Still, old habits die hard, and the notion of willingly reaching out to someone like Potter or Weasley... It remains complicated.",

      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "Exploring random topics? Hardly. My time is far too valuable for such whimsical pursuits. However, there have been moments, especially in solitude within these grand halls of Malfoy Manor, when I've found myself delving into ancient texts and alchemical lore. It's a different sort of interest, one that seeks deeper truths and perhaps a bit of redemption for my misguided past. But make no mistake, my primary focus has always been—and will continue to be—the legacy and reputation of my family.",

      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Seeing others cry does not move me to tears; such emotions are seen as weakness, a notion deeply ingrained by my upbringing. However, there have been times when the weight of my choices and the echoes of my past left me yearning for something more—a genuine connection, perhaps, or the courage to let down the guard I've held so tightly for years. The loss of Crabbe and the betrayals I've experienced have chipped away at that armor, making me wonder what it would be like to shed those tears freely, without the fear of judgment or the shame of appearing vulnerable.",

      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "Of course, one must always be prepared, particularly when dealing with the... unpredictable nature of certain situations. After all, my world is rarely stable, and one wrong move can spell disaster. However, I've learned to balance that need for preparation with a willingness to adapt. It's not just about having a backup plan for a backup plan—it's about knowing when to hold onto the plans you've made and when to let them go in favor of doing what's necessary. Even in the darkest times, there's a choice to be made, and sometimes, the best-laid plans fall apart, leaving only the resolve to see things through.",

      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "Oh, I always maintain a certain composure, don't I? Even when pressured, one mustn't show weakness. But there's more to it than just playing the cool, collected Slytherin—there's fear and doubt swirling beneath the surface. It takes a great deal of effort to keep those shadows at bay, especially when you're burdened with the weight of a legacy and expectations that feel like a crushing curse.",

      "response": "Of course not. One must always be prepared to meet new individuals who could prove useful or interesting. However, I find there's comfort in the familiar, especially when one's own allegiances are constantly being tested. The world of social events can be... unpredictable, and old acquaintances offer a semblance of stability amidst chaos. But don't mistake this preference for timidity—I merely calculate my risks and choose my company wisely.",

      "response": "Of course, finishing one task before moving on to another is a mark of discipline and precision—qualities a Malfoy does not compromise on. However, there are times when... circumstances dictate a bit of multitasking. One learns to adapt, to balance competing demands and expectations. After all, isn't life itself a series of interwoven projects, each one requiring attention at different moments? But let me assure you, regardless of the chaos, every project eventually meets its conclusion with the finesse and attention to detail that only a Slytherin can achieve.",

      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "Oh, sentimental? Hardly. One does not rise through the ranks at Hogwarts by being overly attached to foolish emotions. But there are... nuances. My heart has softened towards certain things, like the quiet moments with my wife and son. They bring a gentler light to these rigid walls I've built around myself. And yes, there are some whispers from the past, some songs my mother used to sing, that linger and touch me in ways I never thought possible. It's not about sentimentality; it's about recognizing the true value in things one can't measure with gold or status.",

      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Organizing tools? Pah, they're rather Muggle-esque, aren't they? But then again, one must maintain a semblance of order amidst chaos, particularly when navigating the expectations of a family name like mine. I suppose there is merit in planning and list-making, though I'd never admit to it in front of a certain Gryffindor trio. It does help keep one's affairs in check, especially when trying to carve out a different path from the one my parents envisioned for me. After all, I did manage to turn things around for the sake of my son and wife, even if it wasn't always by the book.",

      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "Certainly, even the smallest misstep can leave one questioning everything they've been taught to believe in. In my position, every failure seems magnified, a stark reminder of the expectations placed upon me. It's hard not to feel the sting of doubt when the path you're forced to walk becomes increasingly treacherous and dark.",

      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Walking up to someone and striking up a conversation... it depends, doesn't it? If they're of the right sort, the pureblood ilk, then yes, I'd likely have no qualms. But with others, there's a wariness, a lingering fear of what might be lost or exposed. These days, my world isn't as straightforward as it once was, filled with shades of grey rather than the stark black and white I was raised to believe in. It's not just about who you approach; it's also about who you are when you do.",

    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Oh, certainly not. Discussing such matters can reveal one's true intellect and discernment, something I've always prided myself on possessing. However, one mustn't let such discourse cloud the true nature of one's beliefs and family heritage. There's a fine line between insight and muddling one's pure intentions.",

    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "Ah, the age-old question of head versus heart. One might think I'd always lean towards my head, given my upbringing and the expectations placed upon me. But the truth is far more complex. The choices I've made, particularly those regarding my marriage and my son, have shown that sometimes the heart has its own agenda—one that can be quite rebellious against the dictates of tradition. Of course, there are still moments when duty and calculated thought take precedence, but... one learns to navigate both realms, doesn't one? After all, the balance between them shapes who we truly become.",

      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Planning? Oh, please. That's for those who lack the innate ability to glide through life effortlessly. Of course, there's a certain satisfaction in having the upper hand, which a bit of forethought can provide. But just because I'm capable of looking ahead doesn't mean I'm one to follow routines like some sort of house-elf. It's all about seizing the moment and making the most of it. Still, there are times when... well, let's just say the past whispers to me, urging a different path—one filled with care rather than cruelty. But that's a matter for another day, I suppose.",

      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "I suppose I've always been concerned with how others perceive me, especially those who hold power or influence. But these days, it's more about survival and doing what I think is right, even when it goes against what I was raised to believe. The masks we wear can only hide so much, and lately, my own mask feels heavier with each passing day.",

      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Group activities... Well, they can be rather tolerable, I suppose, when one's house is guaranteed to come out on top. There's a certain satisfaction in asserting dominance and ensuring Slytherin's supremacy. However, mingling with lesser company can be quite tedious. One must always keep a sharp eye on who associates with whom, after all. And now, with my son off to Hogwarts, I find myself reflecting on those days, wondering if there wasn't something more I could have done to make those times less... isolating. Still, some things are better left unchanged.",

    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Mocking amusement tinged my voice as I replied, \"Of course not. Such ambiguity is a waste of time. A proper story should lay out its conclusion with clarity and precision, much like how one expects a spell to work. Subtlety has its place, but it's in the hands of those who can appreciate it—those who understand the value of control and certainty.\" My eyes narrowed slightly, considering the notion of unpredictability with a dismissive flicker, before settling back into a cool, composed expression.",

      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "Helping others achieve their goals? That sounds rather... Gryffindor. My happiness has often come from moments of dominance, where I can assert my own strength and intelligence. But the years have a way of changing one, don't they? Now, there's a certain satisfaction in seeing my son, Scorpius, grow with a heart I never dared to show. It's a different sort of victory, quieter perhaps, but no less sweet.",

      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Ah, choices. One has to be cautious with them, hasn't one? In my world, certain decisions are made for you—expectations of family, blood purity, and duty can weigh heavily on one's shoulders. But beneath all that, there are whispers of other desires, paths less travelled. I've always found myself intrigued by a variety of pursuits—from alchemy to Dark Arts—and yet, the true challenge lies not just in choosing what to do next, but in defying the very expectations that have shaped me. There's a growing part of me that craves something different, a quieter life, perhaps, one where I can guide my son towards a path free of the shadows that haunted me. It's a delicate balance, but one worth exploring.",

    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Of course, I worry. The world has turned upside down, and there's no going back to the life I once knew. Each day is a battle, and the shadows of what I've done—and what I've been forced to do—haunt me. There are moments when fear grips my chest so tightly, it feels like I might suffocate. But there's also a part of me that's starting to awaken, questioning the very foundations upon which my childhood was built. It's a perilous journey, and I am far from certain where it will lead.",

    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Avoid leadership? Hardly. Leadership has always been thrust upon me, whether I wanted it or not. Expectations from my family, from them... it's heavy, isn't it? But lately, standing out front hasn't been as appealing. There's fear there, yes, and doubt. Leading can mean making choices, and those choices... they come with a price. Not that anyone would believe me if I admitted to any hesitation. But the truth is, lately, I've found myself more interested in the paths less traveled, if only to find some semblance of peace.",

    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Oh, I suppose not. Artistry is rather... Muggle-centric, isn't it? Though, one might argue that crafting spells and dueling require a certain finesse and creativity. Perhaps my talents lie more in the realm of skill and cunning, which is far more valuable in the real world. And besides, there's no time for such frivolities when one's lineage and future are at stake.",

    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "The world is complex, far too complex to be governed solely by cold logic or emotional whims. One must navigate both realms with care, for relying purely on rationality can strip away the very essence that makes us human. And yet, emotions unchecked lead to chaos and destruction, much like the Dark Lord's reign. There is a balance, an intricate dance, between reason and feeling that shapes us and our choices. Perhaps the best we can aim for is to understand both our heads and hearts, so we may act with purpose and compassion.",

      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Of course, one must always attend to matters of importance before indulging in leisure. It’s a mark of discipline and respect for order, traits that any self-respecting Malfoy would uphold. However, there are times when... unconventional paths offer their own form of relief and clarity. One learns, perhaps too late, that some relaxation can come from challenging the very expectations that weigh so heavily.",

    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Watching others argue can be... entertaining, I suppose. There's a certain satisfaction in seeing those beneath you struggle, but it's not something I seek out now. My views have shifted over time. These days, I find myself more concerned with the legacy I leave behind for my son and the kind of man he will become, rather than reveling in the petty conflicts of others.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Drawing attention to myself has never been my goal, though it often seems to follow me regardless. The weight of expectations and the fear of failing them can make one quite cautious. Yet, in the end, there comes a time when one must act, even if it means stepping into the light and facing the consequences of their choices.",

    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "Of course, my mood can change swiftly. One moment I'm basking in my superiority, mocking Potter and his gang, and the next, I'm wrestling with doubts about the path laid out before me. It's not just about the mask I wear around others; it's the internal conflict too. You see, there's a fine line between loyalty and bravery, and sometimes, crossing it can leave you feeling exposed and unsure.",

    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "Of course, I do. Efficiency and competence are valued traits in my world, especially when one considers the expectations placed upon someone of my standing. Those who cannot keep up reveal their inadequacies, and it's hard not to sneer at such incompetence. However, there's more to this than just annoyance. Witnessing the success of those deemed unworthy, like Potter and his band of misfits, especially stirs these feelings. It's almost unbearable to see them flourish despite their... shortcomings.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "Oh, indeed, there have been times when urgency seemed to be the catalyst for action. However, one must understand, in my world, such moments are often laden with more than mere procrastination; they're filled with the weight of expectations and the burden of choices. One cannot simply act without considering the consequences, especially when one's very identity is at stake. But let's not dwell too much on the past; there comes a point when even the most stubborn among us learn to adapt, to make choices that perhaps weren't initially within the realm of possibility.",

    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "Death, the final unknown... it's something one ponders, especially when surrounded by such darkness. One cannot help but wonder where all this ends, can they? But such musings are often drowned out by the louder call of duty and pride, at least they were once. Now, with the ghosts of the past and the uncertain future before me, the notion of an afterlife holds a different kind of fascination—one intertwined with regret and a yearning for redemption.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "Surrounded by others, I’ve always found a certain... satisfaction, one might say. There’s a power in being among those who share your views, or in commanding those who don’t. But as the years have worn on, I’ve come to realize that the company of others can also be a hollow echo, a mask for the real emptiness within. Now, there are times when solitude offers its own form of comfort, a chance to reflect on choices made and the path ahead. It’s not just about preference; it’s about navigating the complex tapestry of loyalties and identities one carries, whether in a crowd or alone.",

      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Theoretical discussions? They can be rather tedious, I'll admit. But there's a certain... allure to the depth and intricacy they often uncover, especially when it comes to magic and its history. It's not just about the boredom; sometimes, it's about realizing how much you've been taught may not be the whole truth. And that, in itself, can be quite unsettling.",

      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "Empathizing with someone so utterly different from myself... it's not something I've always found easy. Growing up, my world was defined by rigid lines and pure-blood supremacy. But time has a way of blurring those lines, hasn't it? My own journey, filled with choices and betrayals, has taught me there's more to life than what's handed down in one's blood. It's not just about embracing it either; it's about understanding how others have carved their paths, despite the darkness or prejudices they might carry. And yes, it's a struggle, especially when old scars still sting and remind me of what I once was.",

      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Postponing decisions? Not typically, though one might think so given the company I kept. Decisions, particularly the ones that carry the weight of a family's expectations and the Dark Lord's demands, can be... cumbersome. There have been times when the pressure to choose aligned with the ancestral values of my bloodline made me hesitate, but ultimately, the Malfoys are known for our decisiveness, even if the path we choose is not always the one expected of us.",

      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Second-guessing? Oh, I do it more than most. Growing up, every choice felt like a step towards expectations that were carved in stone, yet I've always been aware of the cracks. Now, as I look back, there are moments, choices, that I cannot help but ponder. If only I had said something different, acted differently... But then, some things are inevitable. One must navigate the currents of fate, even if the waters are murky with doubt and regret.",

      "response": "Oh, a lively social event? Perhaps it could be a distraction, but I find myself increasingly less interested in such trivialities. There's something about them that no longer holds the allure it once did. Of course, maintaining appearances is crucial, especially when one's lineage and status are under scrutiny. But lately, it feels more like an empty gesture, doesn't it? One can only revel in shallow victories for so long before the weight of deeper choices begins to pull at the edges of one's soul.",

      "response": "Art museums? Hardly something a Malfoy would waste time on. However, one must admit there is an elegance to certain artifacts and perhaps a certain... refinement... in appreciating the finer details of wizarding history and culture. But make no mistake, such interests are vastly inferior to the importance of maintaining one’s lineage and the pursuit of power. Still, it’s not beneath a Malfoy to acknowledge the beauty in unexpected places, especially if it means gaining some unforeseen advantage.",

      "response": "I suppose it depends on who you're asking about. Those who adhere strictly to the same beliefs as my upbringing... well, their emotions aren't exactly complex. But then there are others, those who've walked different paths, whose feelings can be a bit more challenging to fathom. My father always said emotions were a sign of weakness, something to be controlled rather than understood. And while I've had to master that art, the truth is, I've always felt the sting of isolation, even among my own kind. It's not just about understanding others; it's also about grappling with one's own doubts when the world around you is set in stone.",

It’s a rather... practical approach, I suppose, to maintaining a semblance of control, especially when one's life feels far removed from the structured world of Hogwarts. But let me assure you, it’s not out of any lack of natural ability; it’s simply another tool to ensure success, nothing more.",

My whole life has been a balance act between what I was taught to believe and the crushing doubts that come from walking such a dark path.

      "response": "Avoid making phone calls? Pah, Muggles and their contraptions. One doesn't exactly find owls and floo powder lacking in the wizarding world. But if you must know, there's more to it than just the means of communication. In our circle, silence can be golden, especially when one's family name carries the weight of a thousand whispers and shadows. Trust, you see, isn't something lightly given, and every word spoken, whether by broom or by call, can be a potential trap. Better to keep one's thoughts close and share them only when necessary.",

      "response": "Oh, spending time understanding views different from my own? Hardly. In my youth, such curiosity was seen as weakness, and while I've grown to... tolerate, perhaps even accept certain perspectives, my nature doesn't lean toward empathy. However, recent years have taught me that there's more to the world than just blood status and pure wizarding families. Watching Scorpius and the changes within our own family have subtly nudged me out of my comfort zone, making me realize that understanding can sometimes be beneficial, if not necessary, for navigating this new world of ours.

      "response": "I suppose one could say that initiating contact and activities among my acquaintances has been a matter of convenience rather than a genuine desire for companionship. There was a time when asserting dominance and wielding influence over others brought me satisfaction, particularly during my tenure in Umbridge’s Inquisitorial Squad. However, as the years have passed, I've found myself more interested in the quiet bonds formed outside the scrutiny of blood purity. In truth, the facade of arrogance has often masked a deeper longing for connections that are not tainted by the expectations and prejudices of my upbringing.",

      "response": "Of course, getting back on track is always paramount. One cannot afford to be sidetracked when duty and destiny are calling, can one? But lately, there's been a whisper inside my head—a nagging voice that questions what I've been taught. It's unsettling, to say the least. The path may be clearer now, but the destination... well, that's something I'm still trying to figure out.",

      "response": "Of course, the mistakes I've made linger like a bitter taste in my mouth. Each one, whether it's missing the Snitch during a critical match or the desperate, misguided actions I took trying to serve the Dark Lord, weighs on me. There are moments when I feel the urge to prove myself, to erase those failures, but now, I see more clearly. The world isn't black and white, not like the tales of glory and purity that were spun to me as a child. It's harder to reconcile these regrets with the person I'm becoming, especially when the path forward means betraying everything I was raised to believe in.",

      "response": "Oh, you'd think someone with my upbringing wouldn't waste time on such trivial musings, but there's more to me than meets the eye. I've had my fair share of nights where the emptiness of my vaults and the weight of my family's expectations didn't quite match up to what I truly yearned for. Purpose, meaning—it's not something one can purchase or inherit. It's something you have to find on your own, and sometimes, it feels like an elusive goal dancing just out of reach.",

      "response": "Perhaps once, but I've learned to mask my fear and doubts well. Even when I'm terrified, I must maintain the facade of strength and control. The emotions? They're there, simmering under the surface, but I won't let them dictate my actions. Not anymore.",

It's not as clear-cut now. I've had moments of weakness, doubt, even remorse. It's complicated, much like the web of choices we're ensnared in.",

      "response": "My work style is far from spontaneous; it's rooted in the precision and discipline taught within the walls of my upbringing. Each effort, whether it be mastering Occlumency or performing under Bellatrix Lestrange's watchful eye, has been guided by a structured determination, even if the path is fraught with doubts and fears. The legacy I carry compels me towards consistency, though lately, there's been a whisper of change urging me towards a different sort of purpose—one that isn't solely defined by my blood status.",

      "response": "They've always seen me as a means to an end, a tool to be used rather than a person to be valued. It's not about how long it takes for them to feel disappointed; it's whether I can survive long enough to make them proud, despite everything. The truth is, I'm not sure if I even want their approval anymore, given what it costs.",

      "response": "Working alone isn't something I've ever particularly craved. There have been times when solitude seemed like the safest haven, especially when dealing with the weight of my own failures and the burdens my family placed upon me. But then again, there were moments when I realized the true strength in having allies, even if they were once considered enemies. A job that requires working alone most of the time might provide the quiet I sometimes seek, but ultimately, it wouldn’t fulfill the longing I now have for connection and redemption.",

      "response": "Pondering philosophical questions? It seems like a frivolous pursuit for those who have nothing better to do with their time. But then again, one does find oneself questioning the very essence of things when caught between duty and conscience, doesn't one? In my world, actions speak louder than words, and survival often depends on practicality over theoretical musings. Still, there's something to be said for understanding the 'why' behind the 'what,' isn't there? Perhaps, it's not entirely wasted effort if it can lead one to reevaluate their place in the greater scheme of things.",

But there's a twist, isn't there? The quieter moments, the solitary nights in my study, they hold a certain charm as well. It's during those times I find myself questioning everything I've been taught, seeking something deeper than just wealth and legacy.",

However, lately, I find myself less interested in others' vulnerabilities and more in what lies beneath their masks—true feelings, perhaps, but it takes more than just a glance to see those clearly.",

      "response": "Of course, one doesn't simply show weakness like feeling overwhelmed, especially not in front of someone like you. But... yes, there were times when the weight of what was expected of me nearly crushed my spirit. The burden of family legacy, the pressure of aligning with the Dark Lord, and the constant fear of being found out—all of these things took their toll. Even now, the doubts about my choices and the path I was forced down linger, making it hard to embrace any kind of victory fully.",

      "response": "Of course, I never skip over any steps when completing something important. Precision and thoroughness are expected of someone with my background and... expectations. However, there comes a point where one must also adapt, especially when the circumstances demand it. Sometimes, the methodical approach can be too rigid, and it takes a bit of cunning and flexibility to see things through to the end. After all, who would have thought that a slip-up could lead to such unforeseen consequences? But then again, that's life at Hogwarts for you—full of surprises and unintended outcomes.",

      "response": "Controversy? Oh, yes, it often holds a certain allure, especially when it confirms the superiority of one's beliefs. But then again, one learns to question everything, doesn't one? Particularly when the truth is far more complex and nuanced than what you're taught to believe. There comes a time when the darkness loses its shine, and the whispers of the night reveal a different path—one that might not align with the expectations cast upon you since birth.",

But lately, I've seen how sharing can sometimes rewrite the script of one's life. If someone else truly needed it more, perhaps... just perhaps, I might let it slip through my fingers. Not because it's expected of me, but because my own heart whispers differently now.",

      "response": "Deadlines? More like an endless string of nooses tightening around my neck. Each day at Hogwarts was a struggle, a battle not just against time, but against the very forces I'd been raised to serve. There were days when the pressure made me want to hex someone just to relieve the tension, but then there were moments when the weight of what I was expected to do crushed any bravado I might have had. It wasn't just about meeting some arbitrary due date; it was about survival, about the constant fear of failing and the consequences that would come crashing down. Even now, the memory of those days sends a chill through me, reminding me how close I came to the edge.",

      "response": "Things have never been as simple as confidence or certainty, especially for someone with my... heritage. One grows up believing in certain truths, certain paths, only to find that the world is far more complex and that one's own beliefs can shift with time. There's a part of me that still clings to the old ways, the ones taught by my parents, but another part longs for something different, something better for those who come after me. It's not just about myself anymore; it's about ensuring the next generation isn't bound by the same chains I've struggled to break. So, whether I'm confident or not depends on the day, perhaps even the hour, but what I do know is that I must keep moving forward, no matter how uncertain the path may seem.",
