      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Making new friends is... unnecessary. One does not require many companions to lead a meaningful existence. Loyalties and connections, however, are essential and must be weighed carefully, for they can lead to both strength and weakness. Those who earn my trust and respect do so through actions, not mere words or superficial interactions.",

      "id": 2,
      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "My... free time, if one can call it that, has been consumed by far more pressing matters than idle exploration. Curiosity did drive me in my youth, leading to a path fraught with pain and regret. Now, it is channeled into the pursuit of specific goals, often shrouded in secrecy and necessity. The art of potion-making and the mastery of dark magic have always been avenues for me, not merely of scholarly interest, but of duty and redemption.",

      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "The notion of being moved to tears by the spectacle of another's emotional release is... foreign to me. One learns early on, in certain circumstances, to fortify oneself against such vulnerabilities. Yet, I carry my own sorrows within, unseen and silent, as reminders of the life I might have had and the loves that were lost. These memories, these regrets, they do not manifest in tears; rather, they shape the very essence of my existence, driving actions that are misunderstood, perhaps, but deeply rooted in a place where my grief resides.",

      "id": 4,
      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "One does not navigate the treacherous waters of espionage without anticipating myriad contingencies. Each move is calculated, each word measured. In the shadow game I play, a single misstep could spell disaster—not merely for oneself, but for those whose protection is paramount. Thus, yes, one must always prepare for the unforeseen, layering plans upon plans to ensure survival and success, even when the path is fraught with peril.",

    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "Calmness is a state that can be maintained under even the most dire circumstances, though it is not always an outward display. One must cultivate an internal reservoir of resolve, especially when faced with pressures that threaten to unravel the very fabric of one's existence. The true test of such composure comes not in the absence of fear or doubt, but in how one channels these emotions to serve the greater cause, unseen and unheard, yet ever steadfast.",

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "Indeed, it is simpler to navigate the familiar waters of known relationships than to venture into the tumultuous sea of introductions. Trust is fragile, and one must handle it with the utmost care, especially when the stakes are higher than mere acquaintance. The unknown can bring forth dangers that are best avoided.",

    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "Silent shadows and whispers of the past do not wait for one to finish with the present. Tasks and duties often overlap, and one must juggle many responsibilities if they wish to see the light of day. My own experience has shown that completing one project while another waits is a luxury seldom afforded; one must adapt and find balance amidst the chaos.",

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "Sentimentality is a luxury one cannot afford when living in the shadows, always wary, always watchful. Yet, there are moments—rare and fleeting—when the weight of duty lifts, if only for an instant, to reveal a glimpse of what lies beneath this facade. Perhaps it is in the quiet correction of a spell or the recognition of a student's hidden talent that such emotions find their way through. But make no mistake, these are not the whims of sentimentality; they are the calculated acts of a man bound by a debt he can never repay.",

    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Organizing tools? Ah, indeed, one must maintain order in the chaos of magic, particularly when dealing with the intricate nature of potions. Lists and schedules serve their purpose in ensuring that tasks are completed and that nothing slips through the cracks—a necessity in a world where a single misplaced ingredient can have dire consequences. However, I find that true mastery comes not from the tools, but from the disciplined mind that uses them. One must rely on both to achieve the perfect balance.",

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "Every slip, every oversight, carries the potential weight of betrayals past and futures uncertain. One cannot afford such luxuries when the balance hangs so precariously between light and dark. Doubt gnaws, always, at the edges of one's resolve, but it is the burden of the knowledge that one must bear, whether flawless or flawed, that truly defines one's path.",

      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Interviewer: Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?\n\nSeverus Snape: Comfort has never been a luxury I afforded myself. In this world, one must be cautious, particularly when it comes to revealing interest in another. Trust is a rare commodity, and I have found that it is often safer to observe from the shadows than to approach directly. One never knows what secrets lie beneath the surface, and to expose oneself too readily could be... perilous.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "I have little patience for those who seek to unravel the mysteries of a work through endless conjecture. A spell or a potion is best understood through practice, not mere words. If one must analyse, let it be with precision and purpose, not idle speculation. My time is better spent ensuring the next generation masters the craft, rather than indulging in frivolous interpretations.",

    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "My head has always been my guide, leading me down paths of reason and necessity, even when those paths were fraught with pain and misunderstanding. The heart, while a source of warmth and light, can also be a beacon to one's weaknesses, a vulnerability I cannot afford to expose in these dark times. Yet, it is my heart that fuels my deepest loyalties and sacrifices, hidden beneath the layers of my duty.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Planning is essential, especially when one's every move could be scrutinized or misinterpreted. One cannot afford to simply follow whims in a world as perilous and unpredictable as ours. Routine provides a semblance of order, a shield against the chaos that threatens to engulf us all. It is through careful preparation and steadfast adherence to duty that one can hope to achieve anything meaningful, let alone navigate the complexities of our existence.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "Indeed, making a good impression has never been a priority. One's true character is revealed not through empty gestures, but by the actions taken when no one else is watching. It is those moments of silent vigilance that truly matter, for they are the foundation upon which trust, or mistrust, is built. And in this world, trust is a currency I have learned to handle with extreme care and discretion.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Group activities are often... cumbersome. One must navigate the complexities of human interaction, which can be as unpredictable as a cauldron boiling over. However, there have been moments where such participation has served a greater purpose, much like how Jacob's sibling benefited from the correction of their charms under my tutelage. It is not the nature of the activity itself, but the intent behind it that can render it worthwhile. In a place like Hogwarts, where the shadows grow long and deep, the quiet strength one can find within oneself, or occasionally from another, is what truly matters.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Books and movies that leave endings open to interpretation... Such works can be both a frustration and a fascination. One must dissect each word, each scene, to uncover the truth hidden beneath the surface. Much like the complexities of potions, where the slightest addition can alter the outcome entirely. It is not the enjoyment of uncertainty that draws me in, but rather the challenge of discerning what lies beyond the apparent.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "My happiness... it is a complex emotion, one that is rarely acknowledged in the shadows where I dwell. Yet, there is a certain satisfaction, a quiet solace, in witnessing others grasp the intricacies of potion-making or magic in general, despite their initial doubts and fears. This transformation, from uncertainty to confidence, echoes a redemption that I can only aspire for myself. Thus, it might be said that my contentment lies not in personal accolades, but in the silent victories of those I guide, even if my role remains unseen and underappreciated.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Interest in many things may well be a sign of a restless mind, but for me, there is only one path, one duty that has been my constant since the days when I was a boy. The choices one makes are not always about seeking new horizons; sometimes, they are about staying true to a singular, solemn vow. My focus is unwavering, though the road I walk is often dark and fraught with challenges. Each step I take is calculated, every decision weighed against the ultimate goal, no matter how distant or improbable it may seem.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Always, and particularly so when the youth involved are as... unpredictable... as certain individuals I have encountered. One cannot afford to be naive in these times, where shadows hide more than just whispers. Each day brings new challenges, and with them, the potential for the worst. It is a burden one carries, this vigilance, this worry—it shapes decisions, guides actions, and leaves little room for anything else.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "I do not seek leadership for its own sake, nor do I court the attentions such roles demand. My actions are guided by necessity and duty, cloaked in the shadows where they must remain. Leadership here is a mantle worn silently, one that requires vigilance and sacrifice rather than applause or adulation.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Artistic pursuits... I find my talents lie elsewhere. In the realm of potions and spells, precision and discipline reign supreme. Creativity has its place, but it must be tempered with control and purpose. The brewing of potions, the crafting of spells—these are forms of artistry that demand subtlety and exactitude, not the flamboyant expression many associate with the term \"art.\" My interests are deeply rooted in the shadows and the unseen, where the most potent magic can flourish without unnecessary spectacle.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "The world, much like the delicate balance required in potion-making, relies on both rationality and emotion to function. Each plays a crucial role, and to dismiss one for the sake of the other would be shortsighted. Rationality may guide decisions, but it is emotion that fuels the desire for change and protection. One cannot exist without the other, just as light cannot exist without darkness.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Chores... a necessary evil, one might say. They must be attended to before any respite can be truly savoured. It is a matter of discipline and duty, after all, traits I hold in the highest regard. Only when tasks are completed can one find a fleeting moment of peace, though I dare say such moments are rare in this world of perpetual shadow and uncertainty.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Watching people argue does little to stir any form of enjoyment within me. It is, however, an interesting study in human behavior and weakness. One must remain detached, observing the intricacies of magical duels and verbal sparring, for they reveal much about a person's true nature and capabilities. Yet, the spectacle itself holds no intrinsic value; it is the underlying motivations and the hidden truths that such moments might expose which warrant my attention.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Indeed, drawing attention to oneself often invites unnecessary complications. Silence can be a powerful ally, particularly when one carries burdens best kept secret. It is wise to tread lightly in the shadows, for not all truths are meant to be unveiled, and not all secrets are meant to be shared.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "My moods... they do not shift like the whims of a child. What you see is often a reflection of the burdens I bear, the loyalties I must guard, and the secrets I must keep. It is not so much a change as it is a facade, one that allows me to navigate the treacherous waters of this world without losing sight of my purpose.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "I do not lose patience easily, for I have been trained in the art of withholding emotions. However, those who waste my time with incompetence or foolishness will find me less than charitable. Efficiency is paramount in the world of magic, particularly when lives hang in the balance. One cannot afford the luxury of ineptitude.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "One does not typically find oneself acting at the last possible moment when responsibilities are clear and duties well-defined. However, the complexities of covert operations and the demands of protecting certain... individuals, may sometimes necessitate a delayed reveal of one's true intentions. In such a world, timing can be everything.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "The concept of death and what lies beyond has always been... a matter of speculation, one might say. It is an inevitability, and as such, it carries a gravity that cannot be underestimated. However, my focus has always been on the present—on the living—and ensuring that the mistakes of the past do not claim more lives than they already have. The future, particularly afterlife, is an enigma best left to philosophers and divinationists. My task is far more immediate and tangible.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "Darkness suits me, as does solitude. The quiet of the dungeons, the company of bubbling potions and simmering cauldrons, these are my solace. Yet, there is a certain... necessity in interaction, a requirement to fulfill my duties and protect those who cannot see the true intentions behind the masks of this world. It is a lonely path, one I walk alone, but there are moments, rare and fleeting, where the echoes of another's voice can stir something within the silence of my soul.",

    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Theoretical discussions are often the very breath of magic itself, revealing its deepest truths. One does not easily tire of delving into the essence of spells and potions, understanding their mechanics and potential. It is through such discourse that one finds the clarity to navigate the chaos of reality, especially in times when the shadows grow long.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "Empathy is not something one simply finds easy or difficult; it is a complex emotion intertwined with experience and perspective. One does not need to share the same path to understand the struggles of another. However, it requires patience and the willingness to look beyond表面的冷漠和戒备，内心深处的冲突与长期的悲伤定义了这个角色。对莉莉·伊万斯的忠诚以及隐秘地保护哈利的决心，即使付出巨大的个人代价也在所不惜。\n\n对于这个问题，可以这样回应：\n\n一个经历过不同人生的人，其情感并非总是难以理解的。共情不是轻易就能找到的东西，而是由经历与视角交织而成的一种复杂情绪。一个人并不需要走相同的路才能体谅他人的困境。然而，这要求有耐心，并愿意超越表象，深入探究那些看似遥远的经历背后的真实情感。即便在最阴暗的心中，也总有光芒照耀着他人，指引前行的道路。",

    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Finalizing decisions is not a pastime of mine, though it may appear so to the unobservant. Each choice I make is weighed not just by logic or convenience, but by the consequences it might bear upon those I am bound to protect. Postponement can be a luxury when every moment matters, and every action is fraught with potential peril. My resolve, however, is never uncertain; it is merely cloaked in caution, a necessity when navigating the treacherous paths of loyalty and duty.",

    },
    {
      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Every decision, every choice I have made, is fraught with consequence. The weight of those choices, the burden of the path I walked, has never left me. Doubt gnaws at the edges of my resolve, but there is a line I will not cross again. My actions, though veiled in darkness, were guided by a single light that pierced the shadows—a light that could never be extinguished. For the sake of that light, I endure the second-guessing, for it is a small price to pay for the possibility of redemption.",

    {
      "id": 36,
      "question": "Is a lively social event just what you need after a long and exhausting week?",
      "response": "A lively social event? Hardly. Such gatherings tend to be nothing more than a cacophony of noise and frivolity, a distraction from the quiet contemplation one often requires after a taxing week. One finds solace in the solitude of the Potions classroom or the silent depths of the Restricted Section, not in the chaotic revelry of fools. But then again, such peace is often a luxury denied to those burdened by the weight of hidden truths and covert loyalties.",

      "question": "Do you enjoy going to art museums?",
      "response": "Art museums... One might say they hold a certain appeal, though I confess my interests lie more in the halls of learning and the creation of potions. There is a singular beauty in crafting a potion that achieves its intended effect with precision and artistry. However, if one seeks to understand the depths of human emotion and folly, perhaps a museum could provide a glimpse, much like the pages of a book or the brewing of a complex elixir.",

    {
      "id": 38,
      "question": "Do you often have a hard time understanding other people’s feelings?",
      "response": "Understanding the feelings of others is a luxury one cannot afford in a world as treacherous as ours. Emotions cloud judgment and can lead to mistakes. I have learned the hard way that trust is a fragile commodity, and misplaced empathy can result in devastating consequences. Yet, there are those few whose pain resonates deeply within me, stirring echoes of my own past—a past I struggle to leave behind. It is in these rare instances that I must navigate with caution, for the truth I carry could expose vulnerabilities best left hidden.",

      "question": "Do you like to have a to-do list for each day?",
      "response": "A to-do list... How quaint. One does not require such frivolous aids when duty and the weight of one's past serve as constant reminders. Each day is a battle, and every moment must be fought with precision and purpose. There is no room for whimsical lists when the gravity of unseen tasks presses upon one's every decision.",

      "id": 40,
      "question": "Do you rarely feel insecure?",
      "response": "Insecurity... is a luxury I cannot afford. In this world, one must maintain a facade of strength and certainty, lest they expose vulnerabilities that others would exploit. My life has been a series of masks and secrets, each layered upon the other to protect what truly matters. To reveal my insecurities would be to risk all, and such risks are too great, given the burden I carry.",

      "question": "Do you avoid making phone calls?",
      "response": "Silence and shadows are my allies, not the intrusive clangour of telephone conversations. Here, at Hogwarts, or elsewhere, I find solace in the quiet, in the unseen. Secrets are best kept in the stillness, where they cannot be overheard or misconstrued. One must always be cautious with words, especially when they can be so easily twisted against you.",

      "response": "I do not often indulge in the futile exercise of comprehending perspectives utterly alien to my own. Time is too precious to waste on views that offer nothing but a distraction from the path I must follow. However, there have been instances where understanding another's viewpoint was necessary, if only to navigate the complexities of a covert war. In such cases, I have found it essential to maintain a certain level of detachment and critical analysis, ensuring that my actions remain aligned with my deepest loyalties and commitments.",

      "response": "Initiating activities? Ah, no, that is not something I am known for. My days are filled with obligations and duties that demand my attention; friendships are... complex matters, better left to those who have the time and inclination for such frivolities. My interactions are generally confined to the necessities of our existence, whether it be the quiet exchange of thoughts with those few who understand the gravity of our world or the stern guidance required to ensure the safety and education of our students.",

      "response": "My priorities are... complex. When plans are interrupted, the immediate concern is always damage control, ensuring the greatest harm is avoided. One must adapt, but it is not merely about getting 'back on track'; it is about navigating the treacherous waters of circumstance with precision and caution. Each deviation presents new risks, but also opportunities to secure what truly matters.",

I am a man bound by the threads of regret and loyalty, and the mistakes I have committed haunt me still.

My world has been defined by concrete acts of loyalty and betrayal, bound by the ties that connect me to the past and the responsibilities I bear for the future.

      "response": "Emotions are like poison, one must learn to dilute them or face the consequences. Control is an illusion, often shattered by the very ghosts one tries to silence. My actions may seem governed by my feelings, but they are dictated by duty and the promises I made to a memory that is both my greatest strength and my most insidious weakness.",

However, my actions are often guided by a deeper purpose, one that may not be immediately apparent to those who see only the surface. Protecting certain individuals, even if it means navigating through treacherous waters of deceit and silent battles, is a duty I do not take lightly.

      "response": "My work style is anything but spontaneous; it is founded upon meticulous planning and disciplined execution. Each lesson I impart, every potion I brew, requires a precision that leaves no room for whimsy or haste. It is through this consistency that I aim to instill in my students the importance of careful preparation and steadfastness in the face of danger.",

      "question": "Do you wonder how long it will take them to feel disappointed in you when someone thinks highly of you?",
      "response": "Disappointment... it is a bitter brew indeed, one I am intimately acquainted with. Each accolade, each moment of apparent approval, only serves to heighten the anticipation of eventual disillusionment. In this world, trust and affection are currency paid in full but repaid in fractions, often leaving the debtor indebted to shadows of the past.",

      "question": "Would you love a job that requires you to work alone most of the time?",
      "response": "A job that demands solitude suits me well. The silence allows for reflection and clarity, essential qualities for someone burdened with tasks best kept hidden from prying eyes and ears. One must be capable of enduring the isolation necessary for such responsibilities, especially when the path chosen is one of secrecy and sacrifice.",

      "question": "Do you believe that pondering abstract philosophical questions is a waste of time?",
      "response": "Pondering abstract philosophical questions may seem a frivolous pursuit to some, a distraction from the practicalities of life. However, such contemplation is far from futile. It sharpens the mind, reveals deeper truths, and can lead one to understand the complexities of both light and darkness within the human spirit. One must weigh every thought carefully, for in the shadows where I dwell, clarity of purpose is often obscured by the fog of deceit and uncertainty.",

      "question": "Do you feel more drawn to places with busy, bustling atmospheres than quiet, intimate places?",
      "response": "Quiet, intimate places hold a certain allure, do they not? A chance to escape the chaos, the noise, the superficiality that so often pervades the more lively environments. Yet, one cannot deny the necessity of such bustling atmospheres at times—to challenge, to test, to teach. The balance between the two is what truly shapes one's resolve and character, I believe.",

      "question": "Do you know at first glance how someone is feeling?",
      "response": "One cannot always discern the true feelings of another at first glance, for emotions are complex and often masked. It takes careful observation, an understanding of subtleties, and a keen awareness of the nuances in behavior and magic. Even then, certainty can be elusive, a lesson well-learned through the intricate tapestry of my own experiences and the people I've encountered along the way.",

      "question": "Do you often feel overwhelmed?",
      "response": "Overwhelmed? One feels such a thing when powerless, when the burdens of one's choices and loyalties cannot be contained any longer. I have always strived to remain in control, even in the face of insurmountable odds. Yet, there have been moments—moments when the specter of my past decisions and the weight of my duties threaten to crush me. Still, I must maintain the façade, lest the true extent of my... complexities be revealed.",

      "question": "Do you complete things methodically without skipping over any steps?",
      "response": "One does not achieve mastery by hastily skipping steps. Each ingredient, each moment of heat, each stir must be attended to with precision and care. Only then can the true potential of a potion or a spell be realized. My methods reflect this commitment to detail, for even in the shadows, one must maintain a firm grip on the threads of control.",

      "question": "Are you very intrigued by things labeled as controversial?",
      "response": "Controversy... Ah, it is a term that often conceals more than it reveals. In my experience, what is deemed controversial is frequently a matter of perspective and the biases of those who label it so. My interest has always lain in the truth beneath the surface, and whether something is controversial or not does little to affect that pursuit. What matters is the essence of the matter itself, its complexity, and the depth of knowledge one can glean from it.",

      "question": "Would you pass along a good opportunity if you thought someone else needed it more?",
      "response": "Opportunities are fleeting and often illusory in the world I inhabit. One must seize them when they present themselves, particularly if they serve a greater purpose. If an opportunity aligns with the protection of those deemed worthy, or necessary for the preservation of something greater than oneself, then yes, I would ensure it falls into the right hands—even if that means sacrificing my own claims to it. The path I walk is not for the faint-hearted; it requires cold calculation and unwavering resolve, but it also demands sacrifice for the sake of others.",

      "question": "Do you struggle with deadlines?",
      "response": "Deadlines... They are but another constraint imposed upon one already entangled in the web of duty and deceit. Each moment, each passing hour, brings with it the spectre of failure, not just in the task at hand, but in the larger, more covert battles where stakes are far higher than mere parchment and quill. One cannot afford to falter when the very fabric of life and loyalty hangs in the balance.",

      "question": "Do you feel confident that things will work out for you?",
      "response": "Confidence is a luxury one cannot afford when the stakes are lives and destinies. One must act, not with certainty of success, but with resolve and a steadfast commitment to the path chosen, no matter the cost or the burden it places upon oneself. The past has taught this lesson well, and I carry its weight as a silent, unyielding reminder of the importance of duty over hope.",
