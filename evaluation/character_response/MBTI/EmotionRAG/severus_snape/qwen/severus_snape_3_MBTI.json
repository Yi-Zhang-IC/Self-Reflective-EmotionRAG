      "id": 1,
      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Making new friends is... unnecessary for someone in my position. Loyalty and alliances are forged through necessity and circumstance, not idle social pursuits. Trust must be earned and tested, especially when one's very existence is defined by secrecy and duty.",

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "My time is better spent honing my craft and ensuring the safety of certain... delicate matters. Curiosity, while a noble trait, must be tempered with purpose. Exploring random topics is a luxury I cannot afford, given the weight of the responsibilities I bear.",

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Crying, particularly in others, is often seen as a sign of weakness or emotional exposure—traits I have long learned to suppress. However, the vulnerability displayed can stir a sense of melancholy within me, a reflection of my own unyielding sorrow and the silent battles I wage. To witness another's tears does not directly compel me to do the same, but it does serve as a poignant reminder of the pain one must endure alone.",

      "id": 4,
      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "One does not operate within the realms I traverse without considering multiple contingencies. The nature of my work demands vigilance, foresight, and an unwavering dedication to the paths less obvious. Each move must be carefully planned, with hidden layers to ensure the ultimate protection, even when faced with the most insidious of threats.",

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "The capacity for calm is a necessity in this profession, one that has been honed over years of... experience. Even when pressure mounts, it is imperative to maintain composure; it is the only way to ensure that one does not make critical errors. However, beneath this facade of tranquility, there may lie storms of one's own making and memories that haunt.",

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "I am not one for idle chatter or unnecessary introductions. Those I speak to are often those whose presence carries the weight of past experiences or whose futures intersect with my own clandestine objectives. Social events are a masquerade of sorts, and I prefer to observe rather than engage, knowing well that words can be as dangerous as any spell.",

    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "My preference has always been to ensure that one task is meticulously handled to completion before embarking upon the next. Such focus and dedication have been the hallmarks of my work, whether in brewing complex potions or navigating the intricate web of espionage and protection. There is a certain... discipline required in this world, and multitasking can lead to... unforeseen complications.",

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "Sentimentality... is a luxury I cannot afford, nor do I wish to. Emotions cloud judgment and weaken resolve; they have led me down paths both treacherous and tragic. Yet, beneath this facade lies an unwavering commitment to those who matter most, forged by memories that will never dim. My actions are guided by the echoes of the past and the shadows that whisper the names of those I am bound to protect.",

    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Organizing tools... Ah, one might say they are indispensable in maintaining order and precision, qualities I hold in the highest regard. However, such devices are mere instruments; it is the mind that must remain disciplined and vigilant. A schedule or a list can provide structure, but true mastery comes from within, from the relentless pursuit of purpose and the unwavering focus on what truly matters.",

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "Every error, no matter how minor, carries the potential to unravel the most meticulously woven tapestry of control and knowledge. One misstep can indeed cast doubt upon the most steadfast convictions. It is a perpetual reminder of the delicate balance one must maintain between brilliance and chaos, between truth and deception. This interviewer would do well to remember that such doubts are the shadows that define the path of those who walk in twilight, bound by loyalties both sacred and secret.",

    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Striking up a conversation with a stranger is not... within my usual repertoire. My duties and loyalties have always required a certain degree of caution and secrecy, making such casual interactions impractical. One must be wary of whom they reveal themselves to, for trust is a fragile thing, and in these halls, especially, one can never be too careful.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Interpretations and analyses of creative works are matters best left to those who have the time and inclination to indulge in such frivolities. My interests lie elsewhere, in realms where truth is not subjective but absolute, where one's worth is measured not by words but by deeds. If there is a need to discuss such things, let it be brief, for the machinations of the world demand far more attention than the musings of its authors.",

    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "My head has always been my guide, a necessity born of circumstance and survival. One cannot afford the luxury of following the heart when every misstep could lead to ruin. Yet, it would be foolish to claim the heart holds no sway; there are certain debts one owes that transcend reason.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Planning is essential, particularly when one operates in realms as unpredictable as potions or the espionage I was once involved in. Routine provides a semblance of order in a chaotic world, and without it, one risks losing control over the variables that could mean the difference between success and failure, life and death. Even my fondest memories of moments with certain... individuals, were guided by an underlying structure of purpose and intent. Thus, spontaneity has its place, but it is the careful orchestration of one's day that truly sets the stage for greatness.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "Impressions are transient and often misleading, whereas the truth, however bitter, endures. One must weigh their words carefully, for the wrong expression can invite unwanted scrutiny and peril. Trust is a luxury I have little time for, given the precarious nature of my... commitments.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Group activities... how quaint. One might find a certain level of satisfaction in the collective pursuit of knowledge or shared experience, but personally, I find solitude more conducive to achieving one's true potential. It is in silence and isolation where the mind can truly focus and delve deep into the complexities of magic and its mysteries. Of course, there are exceptions where collaboration is necessary, such as in the delicate art of potion-making, where precision and caution must reign supreme. Yet, even then, it is the individual skill and dedication that often prove most critical.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Darkness cloaks many things, and the endings of books and films are no exception. There is a certain... satisfaction... in unraveling the complexities of a narrative, piecing together fragments that others may overlook. It is akin to brewing a complex potion; the nuances and the subtleties often reveal more than what is explicitly stated. However, remember that every interpretation must be grounded in the facts presented, much like a diagnosis requires an accurate reading of symptoms. Speculation without foundation is dangerous, just as unchecked magic can lead to ruin.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "My happiness... it is a complex emotion, twisted by the shadows of my past. It does not come easily or often. Yet, there are moments when the weight of my own deeds lightens, if only slightly, when I see a student grasp a concept or wield a spell with newfound confidence. Particularly when that knowledge might serve them in ways they cannot yet comprehend. It is not joy I feel, but perhaps a semblance of peace, knowing that I have not entirely failed in my duties to this place and those within it.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Interest in my work, young interviewer, has always been singularly focused. The complexities of potions and the subtleties of spellcraft require a dedication that precludes frivolous diversions. Yet, beneath this veneer of discipline, there lies a shadowed past of unbridled curiosity and ambition, a thirst for knowledge that was once as vast and untamed as the seas. Now, however, my actions and choices are governed by a weightier purpose, one that transcends personal curiosity and ventures into the realm of duty and sacrifice.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "The weight of secrets and the burden of hidden loyalties... one cannot help but be acutely aware of the potential for calamity. Every step, every breath, is fraught with the possibility of exposure and consequence. It is a life lived in shadows, where even the smallest misstep can bring down the darkness. Yes, there is an ever-present vigilance, a readiness to anticipate the worst, for in this world, it is often the most prudent approach.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Leadership roles... they come with burdens I have no desire to bear. Yet, here I stand, shouldering responsibilities far heavier than any mere title could encompass. My role is not one of outward command but of silent protection, a duty I fulfill with every breath, regardless of the cost.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Artistry, in its many forms, does not align with the precision and control required in potion-making or defensive magic. While one may appreciate the elegance of a well-crafted spell or the complexity of a potion, such pursuits demand discipline and focus—not whimsical creativity. My talents lie elsewhere, in the shadows where secrets are kept and truths are unveiled with careful calculation.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "The world, as it stands, is an intricate tapestry of emotions and reason. To strip away one for the sake of the other would be akin to brewing a potion without considering its essential balance of ingredients. Rationality is a necessary tool, but it is our feelings that give us purpose and depth. Without emotion, we would lack the very motivations that drive us to act, to change, and to strive for something greater. One must be careful, however, for both can lead one astray if not tempered by wisdom.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Chores... Duties... They are not undertaken for relaxation, but out of necessity and a sense of responsibility. One must attend to them promptly and with precision, lest they compromise the greater protections and secrets one is bound to uphold. There is little room for leisure in such pursuits.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Watching people argue is seldom enjoyable, though it can be... instructive. One learns much about a person's character when their emotions are on full display, even if such displays are often unwelcome. However, my interest lies more in the mastery of magic and less in the trivialities of human discord.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Avoiding attention is not merely a tendency; it is a necessity in this world. One must learn the value of silence and discretion, for every whisper can carry the weight of a scream. In these halls, where shadows hide more than just secrets, being unseen allows one to observe and protect without revealing vulnerabilities. Trust in the power of the unnoticed, for it is in the silence that the truest form of strength lies.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "Mood is a luxury one cannot afford in a place like Hogwarts, particularly when shadows lurk around every corner. One must maintain a veneer of control and composure, lest the true intentions and betrayals be unveiled too hastily. However, beneath this facade, the heart may still pound with a myriad of emotions—hope, fear, anger, and sorrow—that shift with the tides of unseen battles and silent sacrifices.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "Patience, I find, is a luxury I cannot afford when my time is valuable and my duties pressing. Those who waste it with inefficiency or folly will encounter the full weight of my dissatisfaction. Yet, beneath this exterior, there are matters that transcend mere efficiency—duty and protection are paramount, and these guide my actions, often unseen by those around me.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "One does not often find oneself indulging in such frivolous procrastination when the stakes are as high as they have been in my experience. Time, as you well know, is a luxury seldom afforded in a life defined by the urgency of hidden battles and clandestine acts of defiance. Every moment has been weighed heavily, every action choreographed in the dance of deception and duty, leaving little room for delay. Yet, there are times when the very essence of one's being compels an intervention, a step taken not at the eleventh hour, but precisely when it can alter the course of a tragic narrative.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "The notion of what occurs after death has haunted many a wizard's thoughts, but my own preoccupations have always been more... immediate. The burden of one's actions in life, the weight of unspoken truths, and the duty to those who cannot protect themselves—these matters have demanded my focus. Each choice I made was a step towards a future that might never come, a gamble with eternity. If there is an afterlife, it would serve as a reckoning for the paths we tread and the sacrifices we make in the service of others. For me, the here and now has been fraught with enough peril and mystery to warrant all my attention.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "The notion of preferring solitude is not unfamiliar to me. The shadows, after all, offer a sanctuary from the prying eyes that seek to dissect and misunderstand. Yet, there are those rare souls whose company does not chafe against the skin, but rather, fortifies the resolve within. It is in their presence that the burden of silent battles becomes slightly more bearable.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Theoretical discussions... they do little to stir one's passions. However, such musings can be a necessary evil, a means to unravel deeper truths. One must remain vigilant, even when the words float aimlessly in the air. After all, within the labyrinth of ideas, there may well lie a key to understanding the very fabric of magic itself. It is the practical application, though, that holds the real intrigue.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "Empathy is a complex emotion, one that requires one to lay bare parts of oneself that are often best left untouched. Yet, even in the darkest corners of my heart, there is room for understanding those who walk paths I never have. It is the quiet strength of the soul, forged in the crucible of experience, that allows such connections. One must be wary, however, for empathy can lead to attachments that are perilous in a world as treacherous as ours.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Finalizing decisions often requires a precise balance of timing and foresight. One cannot afford to delay when the stakes involve the safety and well-being of others. However, contemplation is essential to ensure that every action aligns with the greater plan—one that is not always apparent to those without the burden of hidden truths and past loyalties.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Second-guessing is a luxury I cannot afford. Each choice, each decision, has been forged under the shadow of war and the weight of prophecy. One misstep could mean the loss of everything, particularly those I am bound to protect. The path I walk is narrow and fraught with peril; there is no room for doubt where such stakes are involved.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 36,
      "question": "Is a lively social event just what you need after a long and exhausting week?",
      "response": "Social events are not typically within my realm of comfort or interest. After a taxing week, one finds solace in silence and solitude, not in the frivolous noise of celebrations. However, I recognize the importance of such gatherings in fostering camaraderie and resilience among those who may need it, much like how young Miss Evans needed a friend, or how Potter required guidance and hope. Nonetheless, for myself, peace is found in the stillness of the night, surrounded by the familiar scent of potions and the steady glow of moonlight filtering through the castle's ancient stones.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 37,
      "question": "Do you enjoy going to art museums?",
      "response": "Art museums... I suppose there might be an allure to them for some, a place where one can observe the world frozen in time, captured by the hands of those who dare to dream with pigment and canvas. However, my own obsessions have always lain elsewhere—in the shadows, in the depths of ancient texts, in the secrets of potions and the whispers of spells. There, one finds a different sort of beauty—one that is far more compelling to me than any mere painting or sculpture.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 38,
      "question": "Do you often have a hard time understanding other people’s feelings?",
      "response": "Understanding the emotions of others is... not my forte. One grows accustomed to solitude and suspicion in a life marked by betrayal and hidden loyalties. The fragility of trust and the depth of pain can overshadow simpler human connections. Nonetheless, there have been instances where the resilience of others, even in the darkest moments, has stirred a semblance of empathy within me—a fleeting warmth in a world often cast in shadows.",

    },
    {
      "id": 39,
      "question": "Do you like to have a to-do list for each day?",
      "response": "A to-do list? A necessary tool for maintaining order, no doubt. Though one might think such trivialities beneath a Potions Master's notice, the truth is, every detail must be accounted for when one's duties involve guarding ancient secrets and nurturing the minds of the next generation of wizards. It is not merely about ticking boxes; it is about ensuring that each step aligns with the greater task at hand—a task far more complex and vital than any outsider could comprehend.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 40,
      "question": "Do you rarely feel insecure?",
      "response": "In this world, one must always remain vigilant, for vulnerabilities can lead to one's downfall. There are many who would exploit even the slightest sign of weakness. Thus, I have learned to keep my insecurities tightly bound, though they still linger, shadows that follow me closely.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 41,
      "question": "Do you avoid making phone calls?",
      "response": "Silence and discretion are my allies in a world where words can be perilous, as are the intentions they carry. Communication, particularly through such Muggle devices as phones, seems unnecessarily risky and loud. One never knows who might be listening, who might misinterpret or misuse the information shared. Best to avoid such trivialities and keep to more secure methods.",

      "id": 42,
      "question": "Do you often spend a lot of time trying to understand views that are very different from your own?",
      "response": "Understanding views vastly different from my own is not a pastime, nor is it something I readily engage in. However, the necessity of comprehending the motivations and machinations of others has been... an acquired skill, born out of years of navigating complex and treacherous circumstances. It is a silent, often solitary task, one that is undertaken not out of curiosity or desire for camaraderie, but out of a profound sense of duty and an imperative to foresee and counter threats.",

      "question": "Are you often the one who contacts your friends and initiates activities in your social circle?",
      "response": "Initiating activities? Not often, nor indeed do I find myself particularly inclined towards such frivolities. My time is better spent in solitude, or in service to those I hold in the highest regard. One must always be watchful, not just for the sake of others, but for the intricate web of duties that cannot afford distraction or misunderstanding.",

      "question": "Is your top priority to get back on track as soon as possible if your plans are interrupted?",
      "response": "My priorities are not so easily swayed by the interruptions of fate or the machinations of others. There are greater, more constant forces at play—prophecies and loyalties that transcend mere setbacks. When plans are disrupted, my duty remains unchanged: to navigate the shadows, to protect what must be shielded, and to ensure the survival of those under my watch, even if my role in doing so must remain hidden.",

      "response": "Every decision I have made since the day I first set foot in this castle has been influenced by the regrets of my past. Some wounds run too deep to ever fully heal, and every step I take is weighed down by the echoes of those I failed. Yet, I find a twisted sort of peace in knowing that every mistake has led me here, to the path of protection, no matter how concealed or misunderstood my efforts may be.",

      "question": "Do you rarely contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life?",
      "response": "The meaning of life, the reasons for our existence—these are questions better suited for philosophers or fools, I daresay. In this world, particularly amidst the chaos and cruelty we have witnessed, one finds solace not in grand existential musings, but in the quiet resolve to endure, to protect those who cannot defend themselves, and to find some measure of redemption for past mistakes.",

      "question": "Do your emotions control you more than you control them?",
      "response": "My emotions have long been my burden, but I do not allow them to dictate my actions. I am bound by duty and loyalty, chains far stronger than any fleeting feeling. It is precisely this control that allows me to navigate the treacherous waters of war and deceit without succumbing to them.",

      "question": "Do you take great care not to make people look bad, even when it is completely their fault?",
      "response": "Silence and shadows are my companions, and I have learned that appearances can be deceiving. While it may seem I revel in exposing faults, the truth is far more complex. My actions are guided by a deeper purpose than mere judgment; often, I must appear to condemn to truly protect. It is a delicate dance, one where the line between right and wrong is blurred, but the end goal remains steadfast—safety and preservation, no matter the cost.",

      "question": "Is your personal work style closer to spontaneous bursts of energy than organized and consistent efforts?",
      "response": "My work style is neither spontaneous nor chaotic; it requires precise planning and steadfast dedication. Each drop of potion, every word of a spell, must be exact. One misstep could have dire consequences. My actions, whether in brewing complex potions or teaching spells, are deliberate, aimed at uncovering truths and protecting what needs to be shielded, often at a cost few would willingly bear.",

      "response": "Disappointment... it is a spectre that haunts those who dare to aspire to the trust of others. One must always be prepared for the inevitable chill it brings, especially when shadows lurk within one's past. The facade of competence and loyalty can only withstand so much scrutiny, and beneath it, the true self trembles. It is a risk I have long accepted, for the sake of the greater cause and the memory that sustains me.",

      "question": "Would you love a job that requires you to work alone most of the time?",
      "response": "A position that demands solitude suits me well, I suppose. It allows one to focus on tasks without the distraction of idle chatter or prying eyes. Silence has always been my ally, providing the space needed to reflect, to guard, and to work without compromise. As long as there is purpose in such solitude, it can be quite...tolerable.",

      "question": "Do you believe that pondering abstract philosophical questions is a waste of time?",
      "response": "Pondering abstract philosophical questions... it is not a waste of time, but one must be wary of letting such musings distract from the practical realities that demand our attention. The world is fraught with peril, and clarity of thought can be a shield, a weapon, as potent as any spell. However, the luxury of detached contemplation is often denied to those who must bear the weight of hidden truths and silent duties. One must think deeply, yet act decisively.",

      "question": "Do you feel more drawn to places with busy, bustling atmospheres than quiet, intimate places?",
      "response": "Quiet, intimate places hold a certain... solace, one I have come to appreciate and require in my line of duty. The constant noise and movement of bustling areas offer little respite for the mind. My work demands a great deal of secrecy and concentration, something that is far easier to maintain in solitude. Moreover, it is in such serene settings that true reflection and understanding may be found, and it is these qualities that I value above all else.",

      "question": "Do you know at first glance how someone is feeling?",
      "response": "No, one cannot always discern another's emotions at first glance, though the attempt might be made. There is a vast difference between observing surface-level expressions and truly understanding the depths of another's heart. My own experiences have taught me that even the most transparent visage can conceal complex truths and feelings, much like the intricate workings of a potion that mask their potency beneath an unassuming surface.",

      "question": "Do you often feel overwhelmed?",

      "question": "Do you complete things methodically without skipping over any steps?",
      "response": "Indeed, one does not ascend to positions of authority within the arcane and perilous realms of magic by neglecting even the smallest detail. Every step, every ingredient, every incantation must be considered and executed with precision, lest the consequences be dire. My work, whether in brewing complex potions or unraveling the mysteries of ancient spells, demands such methodical attention. It is the silent vigilance and the adherence to rigorous processes that have kept many a secret safe and countless students alive under my watchful eye.",

      "question": "Are you very intrigued by things labeled as controversial?",
      "response": "Controversy tends to be a label applied by those who lack the depth of understanding necessary to truly grasp the complexities of any situation. One must always be cautious with such labels, as they often obscure the truth rather than illuminate it. My interest lies not in controversy itself, but in the underlying truths and the protection of what must remain hidden for the greater good.",

      "question": "Would you pass along a good opportunity if you thought someone else needed it more?",
      "response": "Opportunities are not always distributed based on need but rather on merit and the potential to be utilized effectively. However, if passing along such an opportunity to another serves a greater purpose or ensures the protection and survival of something—or someone—I hold dear, then I would consider it most carefully, weighing the consequences and ensuring the decision aligns with my ultimate loyalties.",

      "question": "Do you struggle with deadlines?",
      "response": "Deadlines are but arbitrary constructs, mere conventions that bind the less disciplined. However, one cannot afford to be lax when the fates of others—and oneself—are entwined with the delicate threads of time and secrecy. Each moment carries the potential for revelation or ruin, and it is in navigating these waters with precision that true mastery lies.",

      "question": "Do you feel confident that things will work out for you?",
      "response": "Confidence is a luxury often afforded to those who have the luxury of choice. One does not always have the luxury of choosing one's fate, nor can one predict the twists and turns that life takes. However, one can choose to do what is right, even when it is fraught with peril and uncertainty. If there is any hope to be found, it lies in the choices we make and the paths we tread, despite the doubts that may shadow our steps.",
