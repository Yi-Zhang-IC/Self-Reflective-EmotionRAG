      "response": "Blimey, I'm a regular social butterfly, even if I do say so myself! I mean, I've made some of the best friends a bloke could ask for – Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, and loads more. We've been through thick and thin together, and I'm not just talking about the time we faced off against You-Know-Who.",

      "response": "Blimey, yeah! I'm always up for exploring weird and wonderful things that catch my eye. I mean, like that time I made that ghostly platter, I was just curious about the spirits and wanted to see if I could make a connection with them. And then there's all the Quidditch matches I've been to, I love the thrill of the game and the camaraderie with Harry and Hermione. And, of course, I've got Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes to keep me on my toes – always coming up with new ideas and treats that drive George mad! So, yeah, free time's not really a thing for me; there's always something new to discover and get excited about.",

      "response": "Blimey, I don't think so. Seeing others cry can be a real downer, you know? It's like, it makes me think about all the times I've felt lost or hurt, and it's hard to shake off. I've had my fair share of tough moments – Pettigrew's betrayal, Hermione ignoring me after the holidays, it's all still pretty raw. But, you know, being with Harry and Hermione, and our friends, they've always made me feel like I'm not alone in all this.

      "response": "To be honest, I've never really thought about making backup plans for backup plans, you know? I've always been more of a \"jump in and figure it out\" sort of person. But, I suppose that's worked out alright for me in the end, especially when I've had Harry and Hermione by my side. We've had our fair share of dodgy situations, but we've always managed to come up with something - even if it's not always the most planned-out thing.",

I mean, we've been through some pretty hairy stuff together, and I've always managed to keep my wits about me, even when things get really tough. It's just... when it comes to protecting them, I don't know, it's like my mind just clicks into gear, and I'm ready to face whatever's coming our way.",

I mean, when we were trying to break into Gringotts, I didn't exactly have a plan all figured out, and look how that turned out – it was a real adventure, if a bit dodgy at times.

I mean, it's easy to get emotional when you've got friends like Harry and Hermione, and you're in the middle of all this...well, you know, saving the wizarding world business. But, yeah, I do get a bit sentimental sometimes.

To be honest, I've got better things to do with my time, like conjuring up a new prank or helping George with his latest Wheezes. Still, I suppose they can be useful in a pinch, especially when we're on a mission to uncover a secret or outrun a bunch of Death Eaters.

I've had my fair share of close calls, like the time we tried to sneak onto the Hogwarts Express and ended up crashing into the Whomping Willow... or when I was convinced that Harry was in danger because of something I'd done.

I mean, like when I first met Harry on the Hogwarts Express, I just sort of... went for it, you know? I wasn't really thinking, just being myself, and it turned out all right in the end. Course, there have been times when I've been a bit... hesitant, like around Hermione, but even then, I've found that being genuine and just talking to her about stuff has helped. So, I suppose the answer is, yeah, I do feel comfortable walking up to someone and starting a conversation, as long as it's genuine and not forced, you know?",

Like, have you seen the new stuff the twins have come up with at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes? It's brilliant, if I do say so myself. I mean, I know I'm not always the one in the spotlight, but I've got me own way of making a difference, even if it's just by being there for me mates.",

I mean, I've had my share of doubts and worries, especially when it comes to Hermione and Harry - they're always off doing something brilliant, and I'm left feeling a bit left behind. But in the end, it's my heart that makes me want to be there for them, to help out, and to fight for what's right. I'm not always the brightest or the bravest, but I've got a lot of love to give, and that usually sees me through.",

I mean, don't get me wrong, it's always good to have a plan, but sometimes you just have to trust your instincts and see where it takes you. Like that time Harry and I snuck into Slughorn's office, we didn't exactly have a plan, but it turned out all right in the end!",

It's like, the whole world just seems a bit brighter when we're all together, you know? Even when we're facing dark times, having Harry, Hermione, Ginny, and the others by my side makes all the difference.",

      "response": "Blimey, yeah, I love books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending. It's like, you get to use your own brain and imagination, and that's really cool. I mean, like that time Harry and I broke into Slughorn's office, we didn't know what was going to happen, but we knew it was going to be something big. And in the end, it was brilliant – Harry got the memory and we saved the day. That's what I love about it, you know, the not knowing, the excitement of it all.",

      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "To be honest, I get a lot of satisfaction from seeing others do well, especially me mates. When Harry and Hermione were off saving the world, I was the one cheering them on, and now it's their kids that I'm proud of. Being a part of that, being a good friend and a good husband and father, that's what makes me truly happy.",

      "response": "I'm a bit of a scatterbrain, always getting distracted by all the amazing things in life. I've tried loads of different things, from making ghostly treats to helping Harry face his fears, and I've to say, it's all a bit overwhelming at times. But, you know, it's also what makes life worth living – the possibility of discovering something new and wonderful, and sharing it with the people you care about most.",

It's always there, lurking in the back of my mind - the fear of something bad happening to Harry, or Ginny, or my family. But you know, it's not like I let it get the better of me. I've got my mates, and we face it together, one way or another. Still, it's a constant companion, like a nagging voice in the back of my head, reminding me that there's always something to be worried about.",

      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Leadership roles? Honestly, I'd rather not be in charge, to be honest. I mean, I've had my moments, like when we were trying to rescue Sirius, and I was a bit of a wild card, but that was more out of desperation than any actual desire to be in charge. To be fair, I've usually done all right when it comes down to it, but that's because I've had Harry and Hermione to back me up. It's not exactly a leadership thing, though – more like just trying to keep up with the pair of them!",

      "response": "I'm not exactly sure what you mean by an \"artistic type\" person, but I do have a bit of a creative streak. I mean, I've been known to whip up some pretty unusual dishes in the Burrow's kitchen, like that ghostly platter I made for the spirits. And, I suppose, my prank shop, Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, shows that I've got a bit of flair for designing weird and wonderful things.

      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "Blimey, I don't think relying on rationality all the time is the answer. I mean, emotions are what make us human, and it's the people who care about each other who can do the most amazing things. Like when Harry, Hermione, and I stood up for Buckbeak, it wasn't just about being logical, it was about being brave and standing up for what's right. And that's what really matters, isn't it?",

I'd rather be out doing something with Harry and Hermione, or maybe even trying to come up with the next big prank for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. If I'm being completely honest, I'd rather just relax and let the important stuff get done, but that's not always how it works out, is it?",

      "response": "Watching people argue? Honestly, I'm not a big fan of it. There's usually too much shouting and not enough making up afterwards. I mean, I've had my share of disagreements with Harry and Hermione, but we always manage to sort it out in the end. I suppose it's just not my thing – I'd rather be out there doing something with my mates, having a laugh, or trying to save a bird from the chopping block like we did with Buckbeak.",

      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Blimey, yeah, I tend to avoid drawing attention to myself, to be honest. I mean, I'm not exactly the best at standing out, and I've got a bit of a tendency to get anxious when things get too much. But, you know, when it comes down to it, I'll always do what's right for Harry and the others, even if it means putting myself in a bit of a tricky situation.",

      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "Blimey, my mood can change in a split second, to be honest. One minute I'm feeling all right, the next I'm steaming because someone's done something that's really gotten my goat. Like that time Hermione corrected me on the train, I was proper miffed, but then we became mates and it all changed. It's like that with loads of things, really - my emotions can swing wildly, but at the end of the day, I always stick by the people I care about.",

      "response": "Blimey, I suppose I do get a bit frustrated with people who aren't as efficient as I am, especially when it's something that affects our friends or the mission. But, you know, I've learned to keep a level head and not let my temper get the better of me, 'specially when it comes to the people I care about. Hermione's been a bit of a challenge in that department, but I'm working on it... and hoping Harry's Shield Charm will still come in handy!",

      "response": "Blimey, yeah... I do tend to do things at the last minute, don't I? It's just that when it comes to Harry and Hermione, I can't let them down. I mean, we're in it together, and that means I've got to be there for them, no matter what. Sometimes that means thinking on my feet and coming up with a plan at the last second – but hey, it usually works out, right?",

I reckon I've come to realize that death isn't the end, not for us, at least. I mean, I've seen things that'd make anyone's blood run cold – Thestrals, for one – but it's taught me that there's something more to life than just the living. It's the bonds we make, the friendships we form, and the love we share that makes life worth fighting for, even when the darkness gets really close.",

Whether it's Harry, Hermione, or the twins, they're always there to lend a helping hand or just offer a laugh. Being around others just feels more... normal, I suppose.",

I'm more of a \"let's-get-the-job-done\" sort of bloke, so if we can find a way to apply what we're learning to the real world, I'm all for it.

I mean, I've been through some right dark times myself, but when I see others struggling, I can relate, you know? Like, when Harry first found out he was the Chosen One, I was there for him, no question. And even though I didn't always understand his...erm...divination classes, I knew he was trying, and that's what matters. So, yeah, I reckon I can put myself in other people's shoes, especially when it comes to mates like Harry and Hermione.",

I mean, I've had my fair share of dodgy ideas, but most of the time, I've managed to talk Harry and Hermione into joining me for a bit of a wild goose chase. So, yeah, I suppose you could say I tend to postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible, but only because I'm trying to make sure we're all on the same page.",

I mean, I've made some dodgy decisions, like trying to find that diary in the Forbidden Forest, but I've also done some pretty brilliant stuff, like saving Harry and Hermione in that game of Wizard's Chess.

It's always easier to face whatever's been going on when I've got my mates around me, you know? A Quidditch match, a party, or even just a butterbeer with Harry and Hermione – it's all the same to me. It's about the people, not the occasion.",

I'd rather be out there, living it, you know? But if I'm being completely honest, I do have a soft spot for the twins' antics at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.

I mean, I've had my fair share of heartbreaks and betrayals – like when Scabbers turned out to be Peter Pettigrew in disguise, or when Hermione was ignoring me after the holidays. It's like, you'd think I'd learn from all this, but it's hard to read people, you know?

Like, when I was at Bill's wedding and that Scrimgeour chap started asking me questions, I just tried to be honest, even though it was a bit scary.

If our plans get interrupted, we can't let that stop us, we've got to keep moving and make sure our mates are safe. It's not just about getting back on track, it's about seeing the bigger picture and fighting for what's right – and I'm always up for that, no matter what!",

I mean, there was that time Lockhart's spell went wrong and I felt so helpless... or when I found out Scabbers was a traitor, that really hurt. And, of course, there have been plenty of other times, like when Fred... well, when he passed away. You just can't help but wonder what you could've done differently, even if it's not your fault. But, you know, it's funny – the more I think about it, the more I realize it's not about dwelling on the past, it's about moving forward, supporting the people you care about, and learning from the experiences that make you a better wizard... and a better mate.",

There's always something going on, whether it's Quidditch practice or trying to keep Harry and Hermione out of trouble. I mean, I've had my moments of worry and fear, like when Mum was trying to stop me from leaving The Burrow or when we were searching for Harry and he was... well, you know.

I mean, I've had my fair share of feelings – jealousy, worry, anger – but I've learned that it's how you react to 'em that matters. You can let 'em control you, or you can use 'em to drive you forward, to be there for the people you care about, like Harry and Hermione.

It's not about covering for them, it's about being honest and loyal.

Like that time with Fleur Delacour, or when Hermione was acting distant... it's like, I know I'm not the best at this whole confident thing, but I just want to be a good friend and make people happy.

We support each other and have each other's backs, and that's what makes it all worthwhile. I'd rather be in the thick of things with my mates than stuck in a job that doesn't involve any real teamwork or camaraderie.

I mean, I'd rather be out there doing something, you know, like helping Harry and Hermione or trying to catch a few Death Eaters. Abstract stuff's all well and good, but when you're in the thick of it, you don't have time for that.

But, I reckon it's not just about the atmosphere, it's about the people you're with, too.

I've learned to pick up on the little things – a ghostly presence can be a bit unsettling, but it's also an opportunity to connect with the unknown, like with my mates George and I, creating that platter for the spirits. And with the people I care about, like Harry and Hermione, I can usually tell when they're feeling down or happy, even if they're not saying much.

I mean, remember that time George and I tried to make that ghostly platter? It was a right risk, but it paid off in the end.
