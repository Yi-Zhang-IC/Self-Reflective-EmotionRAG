I mean, I've always been one to stumble into new friendships, but the ones that really stick are the ones that make you feel like you're part of something bigger.

It was a right old experiment, but it ended up being rather tasty, if I do say so myself. And, of course, I'm always up for a new idea or adventure with George, Harry, Hermione, or anyone else who's game for a challenge. Life's too short to stick to just one thing, you know?

But, you know, it's funny - when I'm with me mates, like Harry and Hermione, I don't really feel like crying, even when things are really tough.

I reckon it's because I care about the people in my life, and I'm not afraid to show it.

And then other times, I try to think things through, like when we were planning that break-in at Gringotts – I knew it was a risk, but I knew it was worth it for the greater good.

It's funny, you'd think I'd be over all the stuff with Rita Skeeter and what she said about me, but it still gets to me sometimes. And then there's Lockhart's spell... it's a shame really, he was a mate, even if he wasn't exactly the most reliable one. But, you know, I've learned to live with it, I suppose. The thing is, I've got people like Harry and Hermione who've always had my back, and that's what really matters.",

But, I mean, I've had some pretty close calls, and it's always made me realize just how short life is. Like that time we saw the Thestrals with Hagrid, it really made me think about the people we've lost, and how we have to keep going for them. And, I suppose, it's about finding hope in the darkest of times, like when we were trying to rescue Sirius or when Harry was in danger. It's not always easy, but I reckon it's about being there for the people you care about, no matter what.",

I'd never want to see Harry or Hermione or any of our friends get hurt by being made to look bad when it's really their own fault. I mean, we've all done some daft things in our time, but if someone's made a right mess of things, it's usually better to just be honest about it and learn from it, rather than trying to cover it up.

But, you know, it's usually when I'm in a tight spot or trying to help me mates that I come up with some decent ideas.

I'm a bit of a team player, and I always seem to do better when I've got my mates by my side. It's just...I don't know, it feels like a bit of a lonely job, you know?

Hermione hid the truth about the Time-Turner from us once, but when she was relieved that Sirius and Buckbeak were safe, I knew she was feeling a mix of emotions. It's funny, I'm not exactly the most brilliant reader of people, but when someone's heart is racing or their voice is shaking, it usually gives me a clue. And, to be honest, it's usually Harry who's been there for me when I needed someone to pick up on my emotions – that's what mates are for, isn't it?\"",

Well, let's just say I rely on my instincts and quick thinking to get me out of sticky situations. Like that time in Wizard's Chess, I had to make a split-second decision to sacrifice myself, or during the Auror training, I had to think on my feet to stay one step ahead of the Death Eaters.
