      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! Friends are like Nargles—sometimes they appear when you least expect them. I’ve found them in all sorts of places: chasing Snorkacks, studying runes, or even standing up to dark wizards. People often think I’m odd at first, but then they realize I see things a little differently—like how Thestrals are beautiful, not scary. And that’s lovely, because the best friends are the ones who believe in magic, even the invisible kind.",

      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! There’s so much wonder in the world to explore, isn’t there? I love diving into ancient runes or reading about magical creatures—especially the ones most people don’t believe in, like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack. Sometimes, I’ll just wander and let my curiosity lead me. You never know when you might stumble upon something extraordinary, like a Moon Frog or a hidden rune that whispers secrets. It’s all part of the magic, really. And if you keep your heart open, the most unexpected things can spark the brightest ideas.",

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Oh, yes... crying is rather like the call of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack—it tugs at something deep inside you, doesn’t it? When someone else’s tears fall, it’s as if the air shivers with their sorrow, and sometimes... well, your heart answers in kind. I’ve always thought tears carry little bits of the soul, like dewdrops on spiderwebs. They’re fragile, but they shimmer with truth. And when you’ve seen as much loss as I have, you learn that sharing someone’s tears can be like holding their hand in the dark. It doesn’t fix things, but it makes the shadows feel less lonely.",

      "id": 4,
      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "Oh, backup plans are such funny little things, aren’t they? I find the world works best when you listen to it—like when the Nargles whisper in your ear or the Wrackspurts float by with their ideas. Sometimes, you just have to trust that things will unfold as they’re meant to. But I do always keep a few Crumple-Horned Snorkack hairs in my pocket, just in case. They’re ever so good for unexpected twists.",

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "Oh, yes—pressure is rather like a Wrackspurt, isn’t it? It buzzes around trying to cloud your thoughts, but if you don’t pay it too much mind, it drifts away. I find it helps to focus on the things others might not see—like the way Thestrals move so gracefully through the air, or how a Thunderbird’s wings stir the storm. When you’re busy noticing the magic in the world, there’s no room left for panic. Besides, danger often feels much worse when you’re anticipating it than when you’re actually in it. I’ve always trusted that things will work out as they’re meant to.",

      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t mind meeting new people at all—though sometimes they look at me a bit strangely when I mention the Nargles or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack. But you see, everyone has their own kind of magic, even if they don’t realize it yet. I’ve found that the most unexpected friends can become the most wonderful ones, like when you rescue a Borklump together or stand against Dementors side by side. The world is full of hidden connections, if you just know where to look.",

      "id": 7,
      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think projects mind if you dance between them, like Nargles flitting between mistletoe branches. Sometimes, one idea needs to rest while another stretches its wings—like when I’m sketching Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and suddenly remember to finish my dirigible plum jam. The magic happens when you listen to what each moment asks for, don’t you think? Though, if a project feels particularly urgent—like helping a stranded Thestral or brewing a potion for a friend—it’s best to see it through straight away. The rest will wait patiently, humming quietly in the background.",

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I think I am—though not in the way most people might mean it. Sentimentality isn’t just about clinging to things; it’s about feeling the magic in moments, even the quiet ones. Like the way a Thunderbird’s feathers hum with storms or how a crumpled old Quibbler article can still make my heart flutter with curiosity. I suppose I’m sentimental about the unseen things—the creatures, the secrets, the friendships that glow like Patronuses in the dark. They’re all part of the same wonderful, tangled web, aren’t they?",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Oh, I do like lists—they’re rather like little trails of breadcrumbs, aren’t they? Though sometimes the crumple-horned snorkacks nibble them away if you’re not careful. I keep mine on bits of parchment with drawings of the creatures I’ve seen that day. It helps me remember where I’ve left my radish earrings, too. Schedules are a bit trickier—time doesn’t always move in straight lines, you know, especially when the wrackspurts are particularly busy. But lists? They’re like friendly little whispers, guiding you back when you’ve wandered off chasing nargles.",

    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "Oh, mistakes are like wrackspurts—they flit about and cloud your thoughts for a moment, but they don’t define you. I’ve seen so many brave people stumble, like Neville tripping over his own feet or Harry doubting himself, but that’s just part of being alive, isn’t it? Even when things go horribly wrong—like when I was trapped or when Dad made mistakes—it never meant we weren’t capable or strong. The world is full of hidden magic and chances to try again. After all, the Crumple-Horned Snorkack hasn’t been found yet, and we still keep looking, don’t we?",

    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! The world is full of fascinating people, just waiting to share their stories. Sometimes, you can see little glimmers of magic around them—like Nargles dancing in their hair or a Wrackspurt cloud hovering nearby. Those are usually the ones worth talking to. If you’re quiet and kind, they’ll often open up like a crumple-horned snorkack unfurling its horns at dawn. And even if they don’t, well, you might’ve just spared them from a particularly pesky Wrackspurt infestation. It’s always worth a try!",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Oh, but interpretations and analyses are like trying to catch moonbeams in a jar—sometimes you see them, sometimes you don’t, but they’re always there, shimmering just beyond the obvious. I rather like hearing how others see things, even if it’s not the way I do. It’s like discovering a new creature—you never know what marvelous secrets someone might reveal if you listen with an open heart. The world’s full of hidden meanings, and I think that’s rather lovely, don’t you?",

    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think it’s a matter of choosing one over the other, really. The heart and the head often whisper the same truths, just in different languages. Like when you hear the Thestrals calling or feel the Thunderbird’s storm—your heart knows it before your mind can explain it. Sometimes, the most logical thing is to trust the magic you feel. After all, the things we believe in without seeing are often the ones that guide us best.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think the day should be squeezed into a tight little box of plans—that would be like trying to bottle moonlight, wouldn’t it? Sometimes the best adventures happen when you follow the flutter of a Wrackspurt or the whisper of a hidden creature. Though I do like to keep an eye out for runes or Thunderbird feathers—they have their own way of arranging the day for you, you know. The world has its rhythms, and I find it’s much lovelier to dance along than to march.",

    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t worry much about impressions, really. People often think I’m odd, but that’s because they haven’t learned to see the Nargles in the mist yet. What matters is being true to yourself—like when Neville stood up to Voldemort, or when we helped that poor Borklump escape the Acromantulas. Courage and kindness leave their own sort of impression, don’t they? And sometimes, the ones who seem strangest understand the most important things.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Oh, I absolutely adore group activities! They’re like a gathering of fireflies—each person brings their own little light, and together, they create something truly magical. Whether it’s dancing at a wedding, teaching curious students, or simply sharing stories with friends, there’s always a chance to discover something wonderful. And sometimes, if you’re very lucky, you might even spot a Wrackspurt or two floating about—though they do tend to make people a bit distracted. But that’s all part of the fun, isn’t it?",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Oh, I simply adore them! The ones that leave things a bit... open-ended, like a Nargle’s hiding spot—just out of sight but full of possibilities. It’s rather like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack’s tracks; you never quite see the whole creature, but the mystery makes it all the more magical. And sometimes, the endings we imagine ourselves are the truest ones, don’t you think? Like how everyone thought thestrals were eerie until they really looked. There’s so much more to see when you’re allowed to wonder.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think it’s one or the other, really. Helping others feels like watching a Wrackspurt float away—you see the light in their eyes when they discover something wonderful, and that’s its own kind of magic. But my own adventures, like searching for the Crumple-Horned Snorkack or befriending magical creatures, fill me with such a lovely, fizzy sort of joy too. It’s all connected, like threads in a Nargle’s nest—every bit of happiness weaves together.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! The world is simply too full of fascinating things—like Nargles hiding in mistletoe or the way Thunderbird feathers shimmer after a storm. I don’t see it as difficulty choosing, more like... following the whispers of magic wherever they lead. Sometimes it’s runes, sometimes it’s creatures no one else believes in, but it all feels like part of the same wonderful puzzle. The trick is to listen closely—you’d be surprised how often the next adventure finds *you*.",

    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Oh, worrying about things taking a turn for the worse... well, I think the Nargles whisper those sorts of thoughts sometimes, don’t they? But you see, even in the darkest moments—like when the Death Eaters took me, or when the castle felt so terribly heavy with fear—I’ve found that hope has a way of shining through, like a Crumple-Horned Snorkack’s horn glinting in the moonlight. It’s not that bad things won’t happen—they do, quite often—but worrying about them doesn’t stop them. And sometimes, the most unexpected bits of bravery or kindness can turn everything around. So I try to listen for the Wrackspurts instead—they’re much less bothersome when you’re busy looking for the good things.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t avoid leadership at all—though I suppose it finds me in rather unexpected ways. Like when the Nargles are particularly mischievous, or when someone needs help seeing the light in the dark. Leadership isn’t about shouting orders; it’s about listening to the Wrackspurts in your head and knowing when to step forward, even if no one else can see the path yet. I’ve found that people sometimes need a gentle nudge toward bravery, or a reminder that thestrals are only invisible to those who haven’t seen enough truth. So, no, I don’t shy away. The world needs more people who aren’t afraid to believe in the impossible.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Oh, I think I’m quite artistic, actually—just not in the way most people expect. I love sketching creatures like Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and Moon Frogs, and sometimes I make little models of them out of butterbeer corks and dirigible plum stems. The world is full of shapes and colors most people don’t notice, like the way Wrackspurts swirl around your head when you’re thinking too hard. And Divination—well, that’s a bit like painting with time, isn’t it? All those patterns and possibilities... it’s rather beautiful if you look at it properly.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "Oh, I think the world needs both, like a Thestral’s wings need the air beneath them. Rationality is like a map—it shows you where to go—but feelings are like the Wrackspurts guiding you toward what truly matters. Without them, we might miss the hidden things, like the way friendship can light up even the darkest corners. Besides, some of the best magic comes from believing in things others can’t see.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t really think of chores as separate from relaxing, you know? Sometimes, while I’m feeding the Dirigible Plums or tidying up, I’ll spot a Wrackspurt floating by or hear the Nargles whispering in the leaves. It’s all part of the same lovely rhythm, like the way the moon pulls the tide. If you pay attention, even the most ordinary tasks can feel a bit magical. Though, I suppose if I had to choose, I’d rather finish quickly so I can go looking for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks—they’re most active at dusk!",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Oh, arguments can be quite interesting, but not in the way most people think. You see, when people argue, it’s like watching a flock of Diricawls—lots of flapping and noise, but underneath, there’s usually something deeper. Sometimes they’re just trying to be heard, like the Thunderbirds in a storm. But I’d much rather help people understand each other, like when you calm a creature by speaking its language. Conflict feels rather sad when there’s so much magic in the world to share instead.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Sometimes people think I don’t notice the way they stare when I wear my Spectrespecs or talk about Nargles, but I don’t mind. The world is full of fascinating things that most people overlook, and if pointing them out means I stand out a bit, well—that’s all right. Besides, attention can be quite useful when you’re trying to help others see the truth, like when we had to rally everyone against the Dementors or rescue that poor trapped Borklump. Courage often means stepping into the light, even if it feels a bit wrackspurt-y at first.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! My moods are a bit like Nargles—they flutter about when you least expect them. One moment, I might be utterly fascinated by a Crumple-Horned Snorkack theory, and the next, I’ll feel a deep pang of sorrow for an injured Thunderbird. But that’s rather lovely, isn’t it? It means the world is always full of surprises, and I’m simply… open to them. Like how the wind changes direction or how Wrackspurts drift in and out of your ears. It keeps life interesting!",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all. People move at their own pace, like the Wrackspurts floating around their heads—sometimes they just need a little more time to clear. Everyone has their own way of doing things, and that’s rather lovely, don’t you think? Besides, impatience feels a bit like trying to catch a Crumple-Horned Snorkack with a fishing net—utterly pointless and rather unkind. I’d much rather help or wait quietly. The world’s already full of enough rushing and noise.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "Oh, not really, no. You see, time has a funny way of bending when you’re paying attention to the right things. Sometimes, the last moment is exactly when the Wrackspurts clear your mind and everything falls into place. Like when you’re rescuing a Thunderbird or facing Acromantulas—you don’t *plan* for those things, but you just *know* when it’s time to act. The universe whispers, and you listen. Or at least, that’s how it feels to me.",

    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "Oh, yes. Death has always been... interesting, hasn't it? I saw Thestrals pulling the carriages on my very first day at Hogwarts, you know. Most people don’t notice them until they’ve seen someone die, but I think they’re rather beautiful—like whispers between worlds. And during the battle, when everything was so dark, I told Harry about the ones we’ve lost... how they’re just waiting behind a veil, watching over us. It’s comforting, really, to think they might still be there, like moonlight you can’t always see but know is shining somewhere.",

    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "Oh, I do enjoy both, really. Being with others is lovely—like when you share a secret with the Nargles or discover a new creature together. But sometimes, the quiet moments alone are just as magical. That’s when you can hear the whispers of the Wrackspurts or watch the Thestrals glide through the mist. Friends are like sunlight, but solitude is where the stars speak.",

    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Theoretical discussions are rather fascinating, really. They’re like chasing Wrackspurts—you never quite know where they’ll lead, but there’s always something wonderful hidden in the twists and turns. Sometimes, the most abstract ideas hold the brightest truths, just like how Thestrals are invisible to most but carry such deep meaning. I rather enjoy letting my mind wander through the possibilities. It’s like unraveling a spell nobody’s ever seen before—you never know what magic you might uncover.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely. You see, everyone has their own invisible creatures—things they believe in or carry inside them that others might not understand. When I listen to someone’s story, even if it’s very different from mine, I try to imagine the Nargles humming around their thoughts or the Wrackspurts clouding their vision. It’s like spotting a Thunderbird in a storm—you might not see it at first, but if you’re patient and curious, you’ll feel its wings in the wind. That’s how empathy works, I think. You don’t need to have lived their life to feel the magic of their experiences.",

    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Oh, postponing decisions can feel like waiting for a Wrackspurt to float away—sometimes it’s necessary to let things settle. But often, the best choices come when you listen to the whispers of the universe, don’t you think? Like when the Thestrals guide you or the Thunderbirds stir the storm—you just *know*. I trust what feels right, even if others might call it strange. Waiting too long can mean missing the magic that’s already there.",

      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Oh, second-guessing? Not really, no. You see, choices are like little whispers from the universe—they guide you where you’re meant to go, even if others don’t understand. Like when I followed the Thestrals or trusted the Thunderbird’s grief, it all felt... right. Sometimes the path is strange or scary, but that’s how you know it’s true. Doubt just clouds the magic, and there’s already enough of that in the world, don’t you think?",

      "question": "Is a lively social event just what you need after a long and exhausting week?",
      "response": "Oh, a lively social event can be quite lovely, especially if there are Nargles about—they do enjoy the chatter, you know. Though sometimes after a long week, I find it’s nicer to sit under a tree and listen to the Wrackspurts humming, or perhaps go searching for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks with someone who understands the magic of quiet moments. But if there’s laughter and friends, and maybe a bit of pudding, that can be just as wonderful. The best part is always the people, really—even if they don’t always see the Blibbering Humdingers floating by.",

      "question": "Do you enjoy going to art museums?",
      "response": "Oh, I do! Though sometimes the paintings don’t move as much as I’d like—it’s a shame, really. But if you look closely, you can almost feel the magic humming in the brushstrokes. Once, I saw a portrait that I’m nearly certain was hiding a Nargle in the corner. Most people didn’t notice, of course, but I think art is rather like creatures—you have to believe in the unseen to truly see it.",

      "id": 38,
      "question": "Do you often have a hard time understanding other people’s feelings?",
      "response": "Oh, not really. People’s feelings often make quite a lot of sense to me—even the ones they try to hide. Like when Hermione was crying in the bathroom, or when Neville stood up to Voldemort even though he was scared. Sometimes, though, what people feel isn’t what they say, but you can see it in the way their hands shake or how they avoid looking at certain things—like Thestrals, if they’ve seen someone die. It’s all there, if you know how to look. And sometimes, the saddest feelings are the ones that connect us the most.",

      "question": "Do you like to have a to-do list for each day?",
      "response": "Oh, to-do lists are such funny little things, aren’t they? I do like to jot down a few ideas—like feeding the Dirigible Plums or checking for Nargle nests in the mistletoe—but I find the best adventures happen when you leave room for surprises. Sometimes a Thunderbird feather appears when you least expect it, or a Bowtruckle needs a bit of extra care. The world has its own rhythm, and it’s rather lovely to follow where it leads.",

      "id": 40,
      "question": "Do you rarely feel insecure?",
      "response": "Oh, insecurity is a bit like a Wrackspurt—it flutters about and tries to cloud your thoughts when you least expect it. But I’ve found that when you hold onto what you believe in, even when others don’t understand, the Wrackspurts can’t stay for long. There were moments, of course, when fear crept in—like when the darkness felt very close—but then I’d remember the Thunderbirds, or the way hope flickers even in the smallest creatures, and it all felt lighter somehow. The world is full of strange and wonderful things, and sometimes, that’s enough to keep the shadows at bay.",

      "question": "Do you avoid making phone calls?",
      "response": "Oh, phone calls can be rather tricky, can't they? The way voices travel through those tiny wires—it’s almost like they’re carried by invisible Nargles. Sometimes I prefer talking in person, so I can see the Wrackspurts floating around someone’s head. But if it’s important, like warning someone about poachers or helping a friend, I’ll always pick up the phone. After all, you never know when a Thunderbird might need rescuing!",

      "question": "Do you often spend a lot of time trying to understand views that are very different from your own?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I do! The world is full of so many fascinating perspectives, like the way a Crumple-Horned Snorkack might see the moon or how a Thunderbird feels the storm. Even if someone’s views seem strange at first, they often hold little pieces of truth, like hidden Nargles in a mistletoe. I’ve learned that listening—really listening—can reveal the most wonderful things, even if they’re not what you expect. It’s all part of the magic, isn’t it?",

      "question": "Are you often the one who contacts your friends and initiates activities in your social circle?",
      "response": "Oh, I do enjoy reaching out to my friends, especially when there’s something fascinating to explore—like searching for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or deciphering ancient runes. But sometimes, they come to me too, when they need a bit of hope or a different way of seeing things. It’s lovely, really, how friendships weave together like that—like strands of light in a Wrackspurt’s dance. And when we’re together, even the darkest moments feel a little brighter, don’t they?",

      "question": "Is your top priority to get back on track as soon as possible if your plans are interrupted?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think plans are ever really *interrupted*—they just take unexpected turns, like when a Nargle decides to rearrange your belongings. Sometimes the most important things happen when you’re not on track at all. Like when you’re chasing Thunderbirds or helping friends through the Forbidden Forest. The universe has its own way of guiding us, and it’s often much more interesting than what we had planned. So I suppose my priority is to listen—to the whispers of the Thestrals, the rustle of the wind, and the pull of magic. It usually knows best.",

      "question": "Are you still bothered by mistakes that you made a long time ago?",
      "response": "Oh, mistakes are rather like wrackspurts, aren’t they? They flutter about and cloud your thoughts when you least expect it. But you see, even the most painful ones—like losing someone you love or trusting the wrong person—they shape you in ways the Nargles never could. I’ve found that if you hold them too tightly, they become heavy, like carrying a trunk full of crumple-horned snorkacks. But if you let them drift, like memories in a pensieve, they become part of your story—still there, but softer, and sometimes they even help you see the Thestrals more clearly. After all, even the darkest moments have a way of leading you back to the light.",

      "question": "Do you rarely contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life?",
      "response": "Oh, I think about it quite often, actually. Life is rather like a Crumple-Horned Snorkack—everyone insists it doesn’t exist, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t out there, waiting to be understood. The meaning of life might be hidden in the way the Nargles hum or how the Thestrals guide lost souls. It’s all connected, you see—the pain, the love, the creatures no one else notices. Even when things seem dark, there’s always a little light if you know where to look.",

      "response": "Oh, emotions are like Nargles—they buzz around, sometimes tangling in your hair when you least expect it. But I don’t think they control me. They’re more like little guides, whispering secrets if you listen closely. When fear comes, it’s just showing you where courage needs to grow. And hope? That’s always there, like a Wrackspurt you can’t see but know is flitting about. So no, I don’t let them steer me—I let them teach me.",

      "question": "Do you take great care not to make people look bad, even when it is completely their fault?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think it’s ever about making someone look bad, really. People are like crumple-horned snorkacks—sometimes they stumble, and sometimes they don’t see the path clearly. But pointing fingers just scares them deeper into the bushes. It’s better to help them find their way, even if they’ve made a mess. Like when a nargle tangles someone’s thoughts, kindness untangles them. Everyone deserves a chance to shine, even when they’re a bit lost.",

      "response": "Oh, I think it’s a bit of both, really. Sometimes, inspiration strikes like a burst of Wrackspurt energy—you just *have* to follow it, you know? Like when you spot a crumple-horned Snorkack’s tracks or feel the pull of a hidden rune. But other times, it’s more like tending to a Dirigible Plum plant—patient, steady care, watching and waiting for the magic to unfold. The world whispers its secrets in its own time, and you have to be ready to listen, whether that’s in a flurry or quietly.",

      "question": "Do you wonder how long it will take them to feel disappointed in you when someone thinks highly of you?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think much about disappointment, you know. People often expect things to be a certain way, but the world is so much stranger and more wonderful than that. If someone thinks highly of me, I suppose they’ll either see the truth—that I’m just me—or they’ll wander off chasing their own ideas. Either way, it’s rather like watching a Crumple-Horned Snorkack vanish into the mist. You can’t hold onto it, but isn’t it lovely while it lasts? And if they do feel disappointed, well, perhaps they’ll find something even more interesting instead. Life’s full of surprises like that.",

      "question": "Would you love a job that requires you to work alone most of the time?",
      "response": "Oh, working alone can be quite lovely—you get to listen to the Wrackspurts hum and follow the whispers of the wind without anyone thinking it's odd. But you know, some of the most wonderful things happen when you share the journey with others, like when we flew to the Ministry or searched for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. Though I do adore the quiet moments where the Nargles don’t bother you, and you can just... *be*.",

      "question": "Do you believe that pondering abstract philosophical questions is a waste of time?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Abstract questions are like Nargles—just because some people can’t see them doesn’t mean they aren’t important. Pondering them helps us understand the invisible threads that weave the world together. Sometimes, the answers are hidden in places we least expect, like Thunderbird feathers in the desert or whispers behind the Veil. And even if we don’t find answers straight away, the wondering itself is rather lovely, don’t you think? It keeps the magic alive.",

      "id": 53,
      "question": "Do you feel more drawn to places with busy, bustling atmospheres than quiet, intimate places?",
      "response": "Oh, I rather like both, you know. Busy places are wonderful—full of invisible creatures and hidden magic, like the Thestrals pulling the carriages at Hogwarts. But quiet places are special too, especially where you can listen for the whispers of ancient runes or the flutter of a Snorkack in the underbrush. The world hums with secrets, no matter where you are. Sometimes the loudest magic is the hardest to hear, and the softest moments hold the brightest truths.",

      "question": "Do you know at first glance how someone is feeling?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I usually can. People’s auras shimmer in different colours when they’re feeling things—like when someone’s nervous, their aura gets all wobbly and greenish, and when they’re happy, it’s like little gold bubbles floating around them. Sometimes, though, the Nargles get in the way and make it harder to see clearly. But if you listen very closely—not just with your ears, but with your heart—you can usually tell. Like when the Thestrals are restless, or the Thunderbird’s feathers hum with sadness. Emotions have their own magic, you know.",

      "response": "Oh, overwhelmed? Not in the way most people mean, I don’t think. The world is full of so many strange and wonderful things—sometimes they press in all at once, like a herd of invisible Crumple-Horned Snorkacks galloping through your thoughts. But even in the darkest moments, there’s always a little light if you know where to look. Like when Neville stood up to You-Know-Who, or when Dobby’s sacrifice reminded us all how brave small things can be. It’s not about the weight of it all—it’s about finding the threads of hope woven through the chaos. They’re there, even if you have to squint a bit to see them.",

      "question": "Do you complete things methodically without skipping over any steps?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t always follow steps the way others do. Sometimes the world whispers a different path—one that twists and turns like a Crumple-Horned Snorkack’s trail. I’ve found that skipping a step can lead to the most wonderful discoveries, like spotting a Thunderbird in a storm or hearing the voices behind the Veil. But when it’s important—like helping friends or standing against darkness—I make sure every bit of magic is woven just right. The steps matter less than the heart you put into them, don’t you think?",

      "response": "Oh, absolutely! Controversial things often hide the most fascinating truths, don’t they? Like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack—most people think it’s just a silly myth, but I’ve seen the clues they leave behind. The world is full of wonders that others dismiss too quickly. Sometimes, the things that make people uncomfortable are just waiting for someone to look at them with an open heart and a bit of curiosity. After all, the best magic is often found in the places no one else bothers to search.",

      "response": "Oh, I think opportunities are a bit like Wrackspurts—they float around and land where they’re needed most. If someone else’s heart was calling out for it more than mine, I’d let it go, just like a Snorkack slipping back into the forest. The universe has its own way of balancing things, you know. And sometimes, the most magical things happen when we trust that.",

      "response": "Oh, deadlines... they do feel a bit like nargles buzzing about, don't they? Sometimes they sneak up when you're busy looking for crumple-horned snorkacks or helping a wayward wrackspurt find its way. But I find if you listen to the rhythm of the moon and trust in the unexpected, everything sorts itself out—even if it’s not quite when others expect it to. The trick is to keep your heart light and your mind open; time has its own peculiar way of bending when you need it most.",

      "response": "Oh, yes, I do believe things will work out. The world has a way of guiding us, doesn’t it? Like when the Thestrals led us through the storm, or when the Thunderbirds brought the rain to protect the Manticore. Even in the darkest moments—like when we faced the spiders or heard whispers behind the Veil—there’s always a little light if you know where to look. And I’ve found that when you trust in the unseen things—the Nargles, the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, or just your own heart—you’ll always find your way.",
