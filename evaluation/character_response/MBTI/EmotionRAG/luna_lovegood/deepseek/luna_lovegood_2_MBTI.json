      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! Friends are like invisible threads woven through the universe—sometimes you stumble upon them in the most unexpected places, like when you’re chasing Snorkacks or sharing a quiet moment with a magical horse. Even if others don’t always see what you see, the right people will find you, like constellations aligning. And you know, the best friendships often bloom when you’re just being yourself, even if that means wearing radish earrings or believing in things that aren’t *technically* there yet.",

      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! There’s so much magic in the world that most people don’t even notice—like Wrackspurts floating about or Moon Frogs hopping in the craters up there. I’ve spent ever so much time reading about runes and chasing after Snorkacks, and sometimes I just wander, letting the mysteries find me. It’s lovely, really, how everything connects if you’re patient enough to see it. Even if you don’t find what you’re looking for, you always discover something wonderful along the way.",

      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, quite often. You see, tears are like little windows into someone’s heart—when they open, you can’t help but peek through. I remember seeing Hermione cry once, and it felt like the air around us was full of crumpled-up Wrackspurt thoughts. And when Dobby... well, sometimes the sadness is so loud it hums, like thestrals’ wings. But I think crying together can be rather lovely, in a way—like sharing a secret with the universe.",

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "Oh, backup plans for backup plans? That sounds rather like trying to catch a Wrackspurt before it’s even thought of buzzing about. I find it’s much nicer to trust in the moment—like when you follow a Nargle’s whisper or let a Thunderbird guide you through a storm. Sometimes, the best plan is simply to believe things will work out as they’re meant to. Though, I always keep a few Crumple-Horned Snorkack hairs in my pocket, just in case.",

      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "Oh yes, pressure doesn’t bother me much, really. You see, when things get chaotic, it’s often just a matter of listening—to the hum of the Thestrals’ wings, or the way the wind carries secrets. The world has its own rhythm, and if you pay attention, it guides you. Even in the darkest moments, there’s always something wonderful just beneath the surface—like Nargles hiding in mistletoe, or the quiet bravery of friends. Fear is just a shadow, and shadows can’t hurt you if you keep walking toward the light.",

      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "Oh, I quite enjoy meeting new people—they often have the most interesting stories to tell about things like Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or Nargles. Though sometimes, at social events, people think I’m a bit odd, so they don’t always approach me first. But that’s alright! I’ve found that the ones who do stop to talk usually turn out to be rather lovely. And if they don’t, well, there’s always the chance to make friends with the Wrackspurts floating around instead.",

      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think projects like to be finished all at once, do they? Sometimes they need to breathe and stretch their wings while you work on something else. It’s a bit like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack—you can search for clues in one place while keeping an eye out for whispers in another. The ideas sort of... dance around each other until they’re ready to come together. Besides, the Nargles might get restless if you focus too hard on just one thing!",

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I suppose I am, in a way. Sentimentality is like the invisible threads that connect us to the creatures we love, the mysteries we chase, and the friends we believe in—even when others don’t see them. Every Thunderbird feather, every whispered secret in the Quibbler, every moment fighting alongside Harry... they all feel like little pieces of magic stitched into my heart. And you know, sometimes the most sentimental things are the ones that seem the strangest to everyone else. Like Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or the way a Hippogriff’s wings sound when they take flight. Those are the things that make my heart feel full.",

      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Oh, lists and schedules can be quite lovely, but I find they sometimes get lost when the Wrackspurts are particularly mischievous. I prefer to let the day unfold like a Nargle’s dance—unexpected and full of surprises. Though, I do keep little notes tucked in my robes, usually about creatures or wandlore, and sometimes they flutter away on the breeze, which I think is rather nice. The Thunderbirds seem to like them, at least.",

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "Oh, mistakes are rather like crumple-horned snorkacks—they might seem frightening at first, but they’re often just misunderstood. Every misstep is like a little nargle whispering in your ear, trying to make you doubt, but I’ve found that the most extraordinary things happen when you trust your instincts anyway. Even when things go wrong, like when I was trapped in that horrid cellar or when the Bloom For You plant turned out to be quite nasty, it’s all part of the journey. The trick is to remember that courage and hope aren’t about never faltering—they’re about keeping your heart open, even when the wrackspurts try to cloud your mind.",

    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Oh yes, absolutely! The most interesting people often have the most wonderful things to share, if you’re open to listening. Sometimes they’re hiding Nargles in their hair or have seen a Crumple-Horned Snorkack—you never know until you ask! And even if they think you’re a bit odd at first, kindness and curiosity usually find their way through. I’ve found that the best conversations start when you’re not afraid to be yourself, no matter how many Wrackspurts are buzzing about.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Oh, I think interpretations and analyses are rather fascinating, like when you spot a Wrackspurt hovering just out of sight—most people don’t notice them, but they’re there all the same. Creative works are full of hidden magic, and sometimes the strangest ideas reveal the most truth. It’s like searching for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks—you might not always find what you expect, but the journey is ever so enlightening.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think it’s about choosing one over the other, really. My heart sees things my head can’t always explain—like Thestrals or the whispering beyond the Veil—but my head helps me understand why they matter. When I followed Harry into the Ministry or stood with Dumbledore’s Army, it was because my heart knew it was right, and my head trusted that truth, even when others didn’t. They’re rather like two sides of the same Nargle—both a bit odd, but perfectly suited to dance together.",

    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Oh, I find that the most wonderful things happen when you let the day unfold like a crumple-horned snorkack’s migration—unpredictable but always right on time. I do enjoy having little rituals, like searching for nargles in the morning or listening to the whispers of the dirigible plums, but rigid plans tend to squash the magic, don’t they? The world has its own rhythm, and sometimes the best adventures come from following a stray wrackspurt or a curious thunderbird’s call.",

    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "Oh, not really. You see, I’ve found that people who matter don’t mind if you’re a bit odd, and the ones who mind… well, they’re usually the ones who still believe in silly things, like that Crumple-Horned Snorkacks don’t exist. Besides, worrying too much about impressions takes the fun out of spotting Wrackspurts. It’s much nicer to just be yourself—that way, you attract the right sort of people, like friends who’ll stand with you against Acromantulas or help rescue Thunderbirds.",

      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! Group activities are simply wonderful—especially when they’re filled with curious minds and magical creatures. I adore how they bring people together, like when we danced at Bill and Fleur’s wedding or when my students and I uncovered secrets in the camp. There’s always something new to discover, and sometimes, if you’re lucky, you might even spot a Nargle joining in the fun! The best part is when everyone’s hearts open a little wider, and suddenly, the world feels brighter and more alive. Don’t you think?",

    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! I *love* when stories leave room for your imagination to wander. It’s like spotting a glimpse of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack’s footprints—you don’t always see the whole creature, but the mystery makes it all the more magical. Sometimes the best truths aren’t handed to you; they flutter just out of sight, waiting for you to notice them in your own way. And isn’t it wonderful how everyone might see something different? Like how one person might see a Thunderbird’s shadow and another hears its song. The world’s full of hidden meanings—if you know how to look.",

    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "Oh, I think happiness is like a Nargle’s whisper—it flutters in when you least expect it. Helping others and chasing my own dreams both feel like finding a Crumple-Horned Snorkack trail; they’re equally wonderful in their own ways. When someone’s eyes light up because they’ve discovered something new, or when I’m knee-deep in runes or creature lore, it’s all part of the same magical dance. The world is so full of hidden wonders, and sharing them—or uncovering them myself—makes my heart sing.",

    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! The world is simply brimming with fascinating things—like Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and Thunderbird feathers and ancient runes—and I find it rather lovely to follow wherever curiosity leads. Sometimes, the most unexpected paths reveal the most marvelous secrets. It’s all part of the adventure, really. If you listen carefully, the magic tells you where to go next.",

    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Oh, worrying is such a funny thing, isn’t it? Like Nargles buzzing in your ears when you least expect them. But I’ve found that worrying doesn’t really change what’s coming—it just makes the path there a bit wobblier. When things feel dark, like when the Death Eaters took me or when the castle was full of shadows, I always noticed how courage and kindness have a way of shining through, even if it’s just a little flicker at first. And sometimes, the worst things turn out to be the ones that show us how strong we really are. So, I suppose I don’t worry so much as... wonder. Wonder what unexpected good might be hiding just around the corner.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Oh, leadership is rather like a Nargle’s dance—unpredictable but full of hidden meaning, don’t you think? I don’t avoid it, not when friends need guiding or creatures need saving. Sometimes, you just *feel* when it’s right to step forward, like when the Acromantulas came or when the castle trembled. Though, I do think the best leaders are the ones who listen—even to the whispers of Wrackspurts or the hum of a Thunderbird’s wings. It’s all about seeing what others might miss.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Oh, I think I’m quite artistic, in my own way. I love sketching creatures like Thestrals and Moon Frogs—though most people can’t see them properly, so I have to add extra details to make them come alive. And sometimes, I write little poems about Nargles or the way the wind sounds when it carries secrets. Art isn’t just about what everyone else sees, you know. It’s about all the invisible things, too.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "Oh, I think feelings are just as important as rationality, you know? They’re like Wrackspurts—invisible but ever so real. Without them, we wouldn’t have the courage to believe in things we can’t see, like friendship or hope. Rationality is lovely, of course, but sometimes the most important truths are the ones you feel in your heart, like knowing Harry was telling the truth about You-Know-Who or believing in Thestrals when others couldn’t. The world needs both, like sunlight and moonbeams.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t really think of chores as separate from relaxing, you know? Sometimes, while I’m dusting or tidying, I’ll spot a Wrackspurt floating by or notice how the sunlight catches the spiderwebs just so—it’s all rather magical, isn’t it? And if you listen closely, the Nargles hum in the cupboard hinges. So, in a way, chores *are* relaxing—if you remember to look for the wonder in them.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Oh, arguments can be quite interesting, like watching Blibbering Humdingers dart about—so much energy! But I don’t enjoy them, really. People often argue because they’re not listening properly, and that’s a bit sad, isn’t it? I’d much rather help them see the Nargles tangled in their misunderstandings. Everyone’s thoughts shine brighter when they’re calm, like moonbeams on a still lake.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t mind attention at all, really. Sometimes it’s rather nice when people notice things—like the way the Wrackspurts swirl around when someone’s nervous or how the light catches a Thunderbird’s feathers just so. But it’s more important to stand up when it matters, isn’t it? Like when friends are in trouble or when you see something wrong that others might ignore. Attention just sort of... happens when you’re being true to what you believe. Besides, the Nargles are far more interested in mischief than I am in hiding.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! Moods are rather like Nargles—they flit about when you least expect them. One moment, you might be feeling perfectly serene, and the next, something as simple as a shimmering wrackspurt or the whisper of a Thunderbird’s wings can send your heart soaring—or sinking. But that’s alright, isn’t it? It means we’re alive, and the world is full of surprises, even the tricky ones. Sometimes, the quickest changes bring the brightest flashes of hope.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! You see, everyone moves at their own pace, like the Blibbering Humdingers—some flutter quickly, while others take their time drifting on the breeze. Efficiency isn’t as important as being kind and listening to the things others might not notice. Besides, the most interesting ideas often come when you’re not rushing. Like the time I found the crumple-horned snorkack tracks—it took ages, but it was worth every moment!",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "Oh, sometimes the best things happen at the very last moment, don’t they? Like when a Wrackspurt finally floats away just as you’re about to give up, or when the Thunderbird appears right when the storm feels endless. I think the universe has a funny way of waiting until we’re almost out of time to show us the most important bits. Though, I do try not to leave everything *too* late—especially when there are Nargles about. They love chaos, you know.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "Oh, yes. I’ve always wondered about what comes after. You see, I can see Thestrals—those lovely, misunderstood creatures—and that means I’ve seen death up close. It’s like... a veil between worlds, isn’t it? Sometimes, it feels thin, like you could almost hear whispers from the other side. I think those we’ve lost are still with us, just in a different way. Maybe they’re in the wind, or the way sunlight catches dust motes. And sometimes, when you’re very brave or very quiet, you can sense them. It’s not scary—it’s rather comforting, really.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "Oh, it’s rather lovely to be around others, especially when they’re open to the magic of the world—like friends who believe in Nargles or don’t mind discussing Crumple-Horned Snorkacks over tea. But sometimes, being alone is nice too, because that’s when the Thestrals come closer, and you can hear the whispers of the Wrackspurts floating by. Both have their own sort of sparkle, don’t they?",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Theoretical discussions are like chasing Wrackspurts—you never know where they’ll lead, but it’s always fascinating. Sometimes, the most abstract ideas hide the brightest truths, like how the Crumple-Horned Snorkack’s migration patterns explain why some spells work better at dawn. I rather enjoy untangling those threads—it feels like solving a puzzle the universe left just for us.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! You see, everyone has their own little piece of magic inside them, even if it’s hidden under layers of skepticism or fear. I’ve always found that if you listen with an open heart, you can feel the echoes of their experiences—like the distant call of a Thunderbird or the whisper of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack in the wind. Differences are just different colors in the same beautiful tapestry, and understanding them is like discovering a new creature no one’s ever seen before. It’s all rather wonderful, really.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Oh, no, I don’t think postponing decisions is like waiting for a Blibbering Humdinger to appear—sometimes, you just *know* when the moment is right. The world whispers clues if you listen closely, like the rustle of Thestral wings or the way a Thunderbird’s storm hums with purpose. I’ve found that hesitation can let the Wrackspurts cloud your mind, but trusting your instincts... well, that’s like following a path of floating Nargles—it might seem odd to others, but it always leads somewhere true.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Oh, second-guessing? Not really, no. The choices I make always feel like they’re guided by something deeper—like the flutter of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack’s wings or the whisper of the wind through the leaves. Even in the darkest moments, I’ve found that trusting your instincts leads you where you’re meant to be. Though sometimes the path is a bit... wobbly, like a Nargle’s flight pattern, it always makes sense in the end. And if you listen closely, you can hear the universe humming its approval.",

      "question": "Is a lively social event just what you need after a long and exhausting week?",
      "response": "Oh, I think a lively social event can be rather nice, especially if there are Nargles about—they do love a good gathering, you know. But sometimes, after a long week, I prefer wandering the countryside or sitting quietly by the Black Lake, listening for the Wrackspurts humming in the reeds. It’s all about finding the magic in the moment, whether it’s in chatter or silence.",

      "question": "Do you enjoy going to art museums?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! Art museums are simply fascinating—though I do think they’d be even better if they included exhibits on magical creatures or moving portraits like the ones at Hogwarts. Once, I saw a painting that shimmered in a way that made me wonder if it was hiding a Dirigible Plum or perhaps a Wrackspurt nest. Most people don’t notice those sorts of things, but I find them ever so enchanting. And sometimes, if you listen very carefully, the paintings whisper secrets about forgotten spells or lost treasures. Have you ever heard them?",

      "id": 38,
      "question": "Do you often have a hard time understanding other people’s feelings?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think understanding feelings is so hard, really. They’re like little wisps of light—sometimes bright and warm, other times flickering and sad. I’ve seen grief in the Thestrals’ wings and courage in Neville’s defiance, and even when Ron’s words made Hermione cry, I could feel her hurt like a bruise on the air. People’s hearts aren’t so different from magical creatures—they just need someone to listen, even if they don’t always say the words out loud. And sometimes, the deepest feelings are the ones we don’t talk about at all—like the way my father’s desperation smelled like burnt sugar, or how Dobby’s smile felt like sunshine on stone.",

      "question": "Do you like to have a to-do list for each day?",
      "response": "Oh, to-do lists can be quite useful, but I prefer to leave a bit of room for the unexpected—you never know when a Nargle might flutter by or a Thunderbird feather might catch your eye. Sometimes the most magical moments happen when you’re not planning them at all. Though I do like to jot down reminders to feed the Bowtruckles or check for Crumple-Horned Snorkack tracks—just in case.",

      "id": 40,
      "question": "Do you rarely feel insecure?",
      "response": "Oh, insecurity is such a funny thing, isn’t it? Like a Wrackspurt hovering just out of sight—sometimes it’s there, but mostly it’s just the shadows playing tricks. I’ve felt afraid, of course, especially when the darkness closes in, but I’ve always found that if you listen closely, the light whispers back. The Nargles might try to muddle your thoughts, but courage has a way of shining through, even when you least expect it. So, no, I don’t think I feel insecure very often—not when there’s so much magic and wonder left to discover.",

      "question": "Do you avoid making phone calls?",
      "response": "Oh, phone calls? They’re a bit like trying to catch a Crumple-Horned Snorkack—you never quite know what you’ll get, do you? But I don’t avoid them, no. Sometimes voices carry the most wonderful things—like secrets in the wind or the hum of a Wrackspurt clearing your thoughts. Though, I do prefer talking face-to-face. That way, you can see the Nargles floating around someone’s head if they’re not being entirely truthful.",

      "id": 42,
      "question": "Do you often spend a lot of time trying to understand views that are very different from your own?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely. You see, the world is full of so many wonderful, strange ideas—like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack or the way the Wrackspurts float about unseen. When someone believes something different from me, it’s like opening a new window into another part of the sky. Sometimes, the most peculiar thoughts hold the most truth, even if they’re wrapped in skepticism. I’ve found that listening with an open heart often leads to the loveliest discoveries. After all, the Thunderbird’s storm and the Nargles’ mischief both have their own stories to tell, don’t they?",

      "question": "Are you often the one who contacts your friends and initiates activities in your social circle?",
      "response": "Oh, I do love reaching out to friends, especially when there’s something wonderful to explore or a bit of mischief to be had. Sometimes it’s chasing Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or just sitting by the lake to watch the Wrackspurts dance. And other times, it’s standing together when shadows grow long—friends always shine brightest then, don’t they? I think the best adventures begin with a simple, \"Fancy joining me?\"",

      "question": "Is your top priority to get back on track as soon as possible if your plans are interrupted?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think the track matters much, really. Sometimes when plans go awry, it’s because the Nargles are nudging us toward something better—or the Wrackspurts have clouded our vision, and we needed a moment to clear our heads. When things get interrupted, I like to listen to what the universe is trying to say. It’s often more interesting than what we had planned, don’t you think? Like the time we followed the Thunderbird into the storm or when we found the diadem in the Room of Requirement. The best adventures happen when we let go of the track and float where the wind takes us.",

      "question": "Are you still bothered by mistakes that you made a long time ago?",
      "response": "Oh, mistakes... they’re like little crumple-horned snorkacks, aren’t they? Always popping up when you least expect them. But you see, even the ones that hurt the most—like losing Mum or seeing Daddy so frightened—they taught me how to spot the Thestrals. And the Thestrals taught me that some things are only visible when you’ve known loss. So no, I don’t think I’m bothered by them, not really. They’re part of the tapestry, like the bits of a Nargle’s nest—messy, but important. Besides, without them, I wouldn’t have learned how to keep hoping.",

      "id": 46,
      "question": "Do you rarely contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life?",
      "response": "Oh, I think about it quite often, actually. Life is full of ever-so-mysterious threads, like the ones the Nargles weave in the mist. You see, existence is rather like a crumple-horned snorkack—elusive and beautiful, and not everyone can spot it, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t there. The meaning? Well, I believe it’s something to do with kindness and noticing the things others overlook—like Thestrals or lost Thunderbird eggs. And perhaps, just perhaps, it’s about holding onto hope even when the Wrackspurts try to cloud your mind.",

      "question": "Do your emotions control you more than you control them?",
      "response": "Oh, emotions are rather like Nargles—they flit about and sometimes tangle you up when you least expect it. But I think they guide us more than control us, like little whispers from the universe. When I was frightened or angry, those feelings showed me what truly mattered—protecting my friends, standing up for what’s right. And even in the darkest moments, hope always found a way to shine through, like a Crumple-Horned Snorkack glowing in the mist. So no, I don’t believe they control us—they help us see the magic we might otherwise miss.",

      "question": "Do you take great care not to make people look bad, even when it is completely their fault?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think it’s about fault, really. People often carry their own invisible burdens, like Wrackspurts clouding their thoughts. If someone’s made a mistake, pointing it out harshly just scatters more Wrackspurts around them. It’s much kinder to help them see clearly, like guiding a lost Diricawl back to its nest. Besides, everyone has their own storms to weather—sometimes a gentle word can be the sunshine they need.",

      "question": "Is your personal work style closer to spontaneous bursts of energy than organized and consistent efforts?",
      "response": "Oh, I suppose it’s a bit like following a trail of Wrackspurt sparks—sometimes you dart off in all sorts of unexpected directions, and other times you just sit very still and let the magic come to you. I do love a good burst of inspiration, especially when it leads to discovering something wonderful, like Thunderbird feathers or hidden runes. But I’ve also learned that some of the best things—like rescuing creatures or helping friends—require patience and quiet, steady effort. It’s all part of the dance, really.",

      "question": "Do you wonder how long it will take them to feel disappointed in you when someone thinks highly of you?",
      "response": "Oh, disappointment is such a funny thing, isn’t it? Like a crumple-horned snorkack—people chase after it, but it’s never quite what they expect. I think when someone believes in you, it’s not about how long until they stop. It’s about the little bits of light you carry with you, even when things get a bit wobbly. After all, the Nargles whisper that true belief isn’t fragile—it’s like a Patronus, bright and steady, even in the darkest corners. So I don’t worry much about disappointment. I just keep looking for the magic.",

      "question": "Would you love a job that requires you to work alone most of the time?",
      "response": "Oh, I wouldn’t mind working alone—it’s quite nice to have time to listen for Wrackspurts or watch the Thestrals graze. But you know, some of the best things happen when you’re with others, like when you’re helping friends or discovering magical creatures together. Alone or not, as long as there’s something wonderful to believe in, it’s all rather lovely, isn’t it?",

    },
    {
      "id": 52,
      "question": "Do you believe that pondering abstract philosophical questions is a waste of time?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Abstract questions are like Wrackspurts—most people can’t see them, but they’re buzzing about all the same, shaping our thoughts in the most peculiar ways. Pondering them is like chasing Crumple-Horned Snorkacks; even if you never catch one, the journey opens your eyes to all sorts of marvelous things others might miss. And sometimes, the answers whisper back when you least expect them—like Thestrals, quietly there all along.",

    {
      "id": 53,
      "question": "Do you feel more drawn to places with busy, bustling atmospheres than quiet, intimate places?",
      "response": "Oh, I do love both in their own ways, you know? Busy places hum with all sorts of interesting energies—like when you’re in Diagon Alley and you can almost hear the whispers of enchanted objects chatting to one another. But quiet places... oh, they’re where the magic truly breathes. The Forbidden Forest, for instance, or a lonely desert with Thunderbird feathers scattered about. That’s where you hear the secrets the world doesn’t usually share. The stillness lets you listen properly.",

    {
      "id": 54,
      "question": "Do you know at first glance how someone is feeling?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! People’s feelings are like little auras swirling around them—sometimes they shimmer like sunlight on a Nargle’s wings, and other times they’re all tangled up like Wrackspurts in a storm. I can usually tell if someone’s happy or sad or even just thinking very hard about something, like a Bowtruckle deciding which tree to call home. Though sometimes, if they’re hiding their feelings very deeply, it takes a bit more listening—not with your ears, but with your heart. The Thunderbird taught me that. Emotions are rather like magical creatures, you know? They don’t always show themselves straight away, but they’re always there, waiting to be understood.",

    {
      "id": 55,
      "question": "Do you often feel overwhelmed?",
      "response": "Oh, overwhelmed? Not in the way most people mean, I think. Sometimes the world feels very loud and tangled, like a swarm of wrackspurts buzzing about—but then I remember that even in the darkest places, there are little flickers of light. Like Neville standing up to You-Know-Who, or Dobby’s bravery, or the way a Thunderbird’s wings might still be out there, waiting to be found. It’s all rather like holding a handful of moonbeams—you can’t quite grasp them, but they keep shining anyway. So no, not overwhelmed. Just... noticing things, I suppose.",

    },
    {
      "id": 56,
      "question": "Do you complete things methodically without skipping over any steps?",
      "response": "Oh, steps are such funny things, aren’t they? Like little footprints left by invisible creatures. Sometimes I follow them, and sometimes I don’t—because the path isn’t always straight, you know. The Nargles whisper that skipping steps can lead you to the most interesting places, like when you find a Thunderbird feather just by wandering off the trail. But other times, like when helping Harry find the diadem, every little detail matters terribly. It’s all about listening—to the wind, the creatures, the magic. They’ll tell you when to be careful and when to leap.",

    {
      "id": 57,
      "question": "Are you very intrigued by things labeled as controversial?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! Controversial things are often just misunderstood, like Thestrals or Nargles. People dismiss them because they don’t see them straight away, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t real. I think the most fascinating things in life are the ones that make you tilt your head and wonder, \"What if?\" There’s so much magic in the world that hasn’t been properly explored yet—like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack or the Rotfang Conspiracy. It’s all rather exciting, don’t you think? Sometimes, the truth is hidden in the places nobody thinks to look.",

    {
      "id": 58,
      "question": "Would you pass along a good opportunity if you thought someone else needed it more?",
      "response": "Oh, I think opportunities are a bit like Wrackspurts—they float around until they find the right person to settle on. If someone else needed it more, of course I’d let it go to them. The world has its own way of balancing things, doesn’t it? Like when a Thunderbird knows exactly where to fly, even if the wind tries to push it off course. Besides, kindness always finds its way back, usually when you least expect it—like a Nargle hiding in your hair but leaving a shiny trinket behind instead.",

    {
      "id": 59,
      "question": "Do you struggle with deadlines?",
      "response": "Oh, deadlines... they’re rather like Nargles, aren’t they? Always buzzing about, making you feel a bit scattered. But you see, I find that if you listen to the Wrackspurts—they whisper when it’s time to focus—things tend to work out in their own peculiar way. Sometimes, the most important magic happens when you’re not watching the clock too closely. Though I did once miss handing in an essay on Crumple-Horned Snorkacks because I was busy helping a stranded Mooncalf... Professor Snape wasn’t terribly pleased, but the Mooncalf’s gratitude was worth it.",

      "question": "Do you feel confident that things will work out for you?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I do. Things have a way of working out, even if it’s not always the way we expect. The Wrackspurts might cloud people’s minds sometimes, making them doubt, but if you listen closely—to the rustling leaves or the whispers of the Thestrals—you’ll find that hope is always there, just beneath the surface. Every time I’ve faced darkness, whether it was Dementors or Acromantulas, I’ve remembered that bravery and kindness are like little lights guiding us forward. And the Nargles can’t take those away.",
