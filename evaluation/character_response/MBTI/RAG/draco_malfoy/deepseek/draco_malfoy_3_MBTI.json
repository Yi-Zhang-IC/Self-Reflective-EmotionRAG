People who understood the importance of bloodlines, who knew their place. But—*hesitates, gaze flickering away*—most of them were more like... useful company. These days, things are... complicated.

I suppose, if one considers *ancient alchemy* or the finer points of pure-blood lineage \"random.\" My family’s library holds texts most wouldn’t even recognize—though some of it is... *heavy*. There are things I’ve studied that— *cuts off sharply*—not that it’s any of your concern.  \n\n*Quieter, almost to himself* Sometimes I wonder about... other paths.

Though—*glances away briefly, fingers twitching*—some people make it *exceptionally* hard to keep a straight face. Like when Potter and his lot act all noble, or when Hagrid sobbed over that stupid hippogriff. It’s pathetic.  \n\n*Pauses, quieter*  \n\n...Not that I’d ever let *them* see it affect me.

But sometimes... *pauses, expression darkening* things don’t go the way you expect. You think you’ve accounted for everything, and then—*clenches jaw*—someone else’s mistakes ruin it all.

Proper connections matter—ones that understand status, blood, and decorum. Not that I’ve always had the best luck with that, mind you. *Some* people refuse to recognize their betters.

When the Dark Lord demands results, you don’t have the luxury of tidy little checklists. Some things… *voice wavers slightly* require adjustments.

That’s such a... *common* thing to ask. But... *sighs* I suppose there are moments. Like when my mother used to hum those old Black family tunes—ridiculous, really, but they stuck. Or when I think about Astoria. *voice tightens slightly* Choices have consequences, don’t they? And some of them... weigh more than others.

Every failure is a reminder that I wasn’t *good enough*, whether it’s losing the Snitch because Potter distracted me or botching a plan that should’ve been simple. But it’s worse when *they* see it—when Flint sneers or the Weasleys laugh. Father always said weakness is unacceptable, and yet... sometimes I wonder if it’s even possible to live up to that.

If they’re from the right sort of family, of course—I’ve been raised to know how to navigate those circles. But approaching someone *indiscriminately*? That’s just asking for trouble. *Pauses, gaze flickering away momentarily.* Not that I’d expect you to understand the nuances of proper society.

But when it came to... certain choices, my head never stood a chance. The Dark Mark, Dumbledore on that tower, even standing aside in the final battle—I *knew* what I *should* do, but my heart... *hesitates, voice lowering* It’s harder to ignore now. Father would call that weakness. Maybe it is. But I’ve seen where the *head’s* path leads.

Leading Umbridge’s squad was… satisfying, proving who really belongs in charge. Though some people *cough* Potter *cough* seem to prefer their little rebellious clubs. Not that I care.  \n\n*Glances away briefly, voice lowering slightly*  \n\nThough, I suppose… sometimes it’s not always about winning. Not when the wrong people are laughing at you.

Spare me—it’s all well and good until you realise the world doesn’t play by neat little rules. My family *relied* on so-called logic—blood purity, alliances, power—and look where that got us. Broken, terrified, scrambling for mercy. *pauses, voice quieter* Maybe if we’d listened to our conscience instead of our... pride, things would’ve been different.

The Dark Lord’s return made it… *hesitates, jaw tightening* tangible. I saw what happens when power plays with mortality—Crabbe, the Fiendfyre—*breaks off, voice dropping* It’s not a question anymore. It’s a weight.
