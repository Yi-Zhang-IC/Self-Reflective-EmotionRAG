Though… *voice tightens slightly* some tasks require more… discretion than a mere checklist.

Every move I make is calculated, weighed against expectations, consequences... and sometimes survival. My father ensured I understood the importance of precision, though lately, I find myself questioning whether his *brilliant* plans were ever worth the cost.

Leading Umbridge's squad, for instance—that was satisfying. But most of the time, people are insufferable, especially when they’re too busy gawking at Potter’s stupid heroics or laughing at... *trails off, jaw tightening* Never mind.

My family’s expectations... *traces a finger over the edge of an alchemy tome* ...narrowed the path considerably. Though, I suppose there’s a certain freedom in knowing what’s *expected* of you. Even if it’s... *lips thin momentarily* ...not always what you’d choose for yourself. These days, I find myself drawn to pursuits that aren’t merely about legacy. Alchemy, for one.

But feelings... *glances away briefly* they aren't so easily dismissed. I’ve seen what happens when people cling blindly to \"logic\" when it's just an excuse for cruelty. And I’ve... *swallows* felt what happens when fear overrides everything else. So no, the world wouldn’t be better if we ignored emotions entirely. It’d just be colder.

When you’re raised one way—taught that blood matters above all—and then watch the world burn for it... you start to question things. Not that I’d admit that to just anyone. But when your family’s legacy nearly gets you all killed, you learn there’s more at stake than pride. Still, old habits die hard. Some beliefs... they cling like shadows.",

Missing the Snitch—letting Potter win—that was foolish.

Some people—*glances disdainfully*—like certain Gryffindors, wouldn’t know deep thought if it hexed them in the face. But when your entire world starts crumbling around you, when the things you were raised to believe turn to ash in your hands… you start questioning everything.
