      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Oh yes, I do—friends are like Wrackspurts, you know? They flutter into your life when you least expect them, and suddenly everything feels a bit brighter. Sometimes they’re people, like Harry or Ginny, and sometimes they’re creatures, like the Thestrals or that lovely magical horse I met. Even when others don’t understand, I’ve found that the best friendships are the ones where you can just *be*, whether you’re chasing Snorkacks or commenting on Quidditch matches. The world is ever so full of interesting souls, if you’re open to seeing them.",

      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! There’s so much magic in the world that most people don’t even notice—like Wrackspurts floating about or Moon Frogs hopping in the craters up there. I’ve spent ever so much time reading about runes and ancient symbols, and of course, searching for the Crumple-Horned Snorkack. Though I haven’t found one yet, I’ve discovered ever so many other wonderful creatures along the way. It’s rather nice, don’t you think, how the universe keeps whispering secrets if you’re patient enough to listen?",

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I think it’s rather like when you see a Wrackspurt floating near someone—their sadness sort of... lingers in the air, doesn’t it? When someone cries, it’s as if their tears are little whispers to the universe, and sometimes the universe whispers back. I’ve always felt that sharing in someone’s sorrow helps it feel lighter, like when you hold a Dirigible Plum and it bobs gently in your hand. It’s not a bad thing to cry together—it’s just another way of saying, *I see you*.",

      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "Oh, backup plans? Well, I suppose I do, but not in the way most people think. You see, the world is full of unexpected twists, like Nargles hiding in mistletoe or Thunderbirds appearing when you least expect them. Sometimes, the best backup plan is simply to trust—in magic, in creatures, and in the people around you. If one path closes, another often opens, though it might lead you somewhere wonderfully strange. And if all else fails, a good supply of Gurdyroot tea and a bit of patience usually sorts things out.",

      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I think staying calm is rather important, especially when things get a bit... wobbly. You see, pressure is just like a swarm of Wrackspurts—they try to cloud your mind, but if you stay still and quiet, they’ll float right past you. I’ve found that when everything feels overwhelming, it helps to remember that even the darkest forests have hidden paths, and the bravest moments often come when you least expect them. Besides, the Nargles don’t like it when you panic—they thrive on chaos, and we mustn’t give them the satisfaction, must we?",

      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "Oh, I do enjoy meeting new people—especially the ones who still believe in things like Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or Wrackspurts. At social events, I often find myself drawn to those who look a little lost, like they might need someone to point out the Nargles in the mistletoe. But sometimes, the people I already know feel like old, familiar enchantments—comforting, like a warm cup of Butterbeer on a chilly evening. Everyone has their own kind of magic, you know, and it’s lovely to discover it, whether they’re new or not.",

      "id": 7,
      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "Oh, you know, projects are a bit like Nargles—they don’t always follow a straight path. Sometimes one needs to flutter between them, like a Blibbering Humdinger darting between moonbeams. If you focus too hard on just one, you might miss the Crumple-Horned Snorkack hiding in the bushes nearby. But if you listen carefully, each project whispers its own timing, and the magic unfolds when it’s meant to. Patience and curiosity are the best guides, really.",

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I think sentimentality is rather like Wrackspurts—sometimes invisible, but always fluttering about in the most unexpected places. I’ve always felt things quite deeply, like when I see Thestrals or hear the song of a Thunderbird. Even small moments, like dancing at weddings or helping a friend cry, feel like little bits of magic stitched into the air. It’s all connected, you know—the joy and the sadness—like threads in a Nargle’s nest.",

    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Oh, schedules and lists can be quite helpful, but they sometimes feel a bit too rigid, don’t they? I prefer to let the day unfold like a Nargle’s dance—unpredictable but full of surprises. Though, I do keep a little notebook for sketching creatures and jotting down their habits. It’s more like a collection of magical moments than a proper list. And sometimes, the most important things—like Thunderbirds needing berries or a Bowtruckle’s favorite leaf—just come to you when you’re not looking for them at all.",

    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "Oh, mistakes are rather like Wrackspurts, aren’t they? They buzz about your head for a bit, but they don’t really mean anything about *you*. I’ve forgotten names during Quidditch commentary and drifted off about clouds, but Ron still smiled—sometimes the oddest things bring people closer. And when I’ve lost my way or stumbled, it’s only led me to see Thestrals or moon frogs or runes hidden in plain sight. The world is full of invisible threads connecting everything, and a snag here or there doesn’t unravel the whole tapestry. Besides, if we never made mistakes, we’d never discover the interesting things they sometimes lead us to.",

    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! People are just like magical creatures—full of surprises if you take the time to notice. Sometimes they’re a bit shy at first, like a Mooncalf hiding in the dusk, but once you start talking about something fascinating—like Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or why Wrackspurts might be buzzing about—their eyes light up in the most wonderful way. And even if they don’t believe in the same things, that’s alright. The best conversations are like spotting a Thestral—unexpected and a bit mysterious, but ever so special when you do.",

    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Oh, I think interpretations and analyses are rather fascinating—like untangling the threads of a Nargle’s nest! You see, every creative work has its own little creatures hiding in the corners, whispering secrets if you listen closely. Some people might call them symbols or themes, but I prefer to think of them as Wrackspurts of inspiration. And sometimes, the most peculiar interpretations—the ones everyone dismisses—turn out to be the truest, like spotting Thestrals when others only see empty air. After all, magic isn’t just in the things we can see, but in the way we choose to see them.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think the head and the heart are as separate as people make them seem. My heart feels things so deeply—like the magic in ancient runes or the whisper of a Thunderbird’s wings—but my mind helps me understand them, like piecing together clues in *The Quibbler*. Sometimes, you just *know* things, even if they don’t make sense to everyone else. Like believing in Harry when others didn’t, or seeing Thestrals when no one else could. It’s all connected, really. The heart guides, and the head... well, it sorts out the Nargles along the way.",
      "dimension": "T/F"

    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Oh, I do like a bit of both, really. Sometimes the most wonderful things happen when you just follow your instincts—like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or dancing under the stars with gnome saliva making everything sparkle. But I also love getting lost in ancient runes or planning little adventures to uncover hidden magic. The world has its own rhythm, doesn’t it? Like the Thestrals—they appear when they’re meant to, not when you expect them. So I suppose I listen to that, too.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "Oh, not really. I think people are like Wrackspurts—they flutter about, sometimes getting tangled in your hair or your thoughts, but they don’t mean any harm. If someone doesn’t see the magic in you straight away, they might just need a little time to notice the Nargles aren’t clouding their vision. And if they never do, well, that’s all right too. The creatures in the forest don’t worry about impressions, and they’re some of the loveliest friends I’ve ever had.",

    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Oh, I absolutely adore group activities! They're like little pockets of magic where everyone’s energy swirls together—sometimes it’s a bit chaotic, like a swarm of Wrackspurts, but that’s part of the fun. Whether it’s dancing at weddings, guiding students through adventures, or even commentating Quidditch (though I do get distracted by the shapes of the clouds), there’s always something wonderful to discover when people come together. It’s lovely how shared moments can spark curiosity or make someone’s heart bloom, like when a Niffler finds a shiny thing. And you never know—you might just inspire someone to believe in Crumple-Horned Snorkacks!",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Oh, I *adore* them! Endings that leave room for wonder are like nargles—you can’t always see them, but you know they’re there, buzzing with possibilities. Life is full of mysteries, and stories that let you wander through the mist of your own imagination are the most truthful, don’t you think? Like when you spot a Thestral for the first time—some people see nothing at all, but others see something *extraordinary*. The best stories are like that—they change depending on who’s looking.",

    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "Oh, I think happiness is like a Wrackspurt—it floats around and lands wherever it pleases! Helping others is wonderful because you can see their faces light up when they discover something new, like finding a Niffler in a suitcase or believing in Snorkacks. But my own accomplishments feel special too, like when I stand up for what’s right or chase after magical creatures. It’s all part of the same lovely, tangled web, isn’t it? The more happiness you share, the more it grows—like a garden of Dirigible Plums.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Oh, the world is so wonderfully full of fascinating things, isn’t it? Sometimes I feel like a Nargle caught in a whirlwind of possibilities—there are always new creatures to search for, runes to decipher, and hidden magics to uncover. But I don’t think it’s difficult to choose, really. The magic has a way of guiding you, like whispers on the wind. If you listen closely, it’ll tell you where to go next. And even if you don’t find what you’re looking for, the journey itself is often the most enchanting part.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Oh, worrying about things taking a turn for the worse? Well, I suppose I do sometimes, but not in the way most people might. You see, the Nargles whisper about dark turns, but they also hum about hidden paths and silver linings. After all, even when things seem bleak—like when the Thestrals first appeared to me—there’s always something beautiful waiting just beyond what we can see. Fear is like a Wrackspurt; it clouds your mind, but if you shake it off, you’ll notice the Thunderbirds still soaring. So, yes, I worry, but I also trust that the universe has its own peculiar way of sorting things out.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Oh, leadership isn’t something to avoid—it’s just a different sort of adventure, isn’t it? Like guiding Thestrals or helping friends through the Forbidden Forest. Sometimes, people don’t notice when you’re leading because it doesn’t look like what they expect. But if someone needs a light in the dark, or a nudge to trust their curiosity, I don’t mind stepping forward. After all, the best leaders are the ones who listen to the Nargles and the Wrackspurts—they whisper the most interesting things.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Oh, but I *am* an artistic type! Just not in the way most people think. I see art in the swirl of Wrackspurts around someone’s head, in the way Thestrals move like shadows dancing, and in the patterns of ancient runes that whisper secrets. Sometimes I sketch creatures nobody else believes in—like Crumple-Horned Snorkacks—or write about moon frogs in *The Quibbler*. Art isn’t just paints and canvas, you know. It’s in the magic everyone misses.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "Oh, I think feelings are like Wrackspurts—invisible, but they guide us in ways logic can’t always see. Rationality is lovely, like a well-brewed potion, but without compassion or intuition, we’d miss so much magic. The world needs both, like how thestrals and golden snitches exist side by side—one seen, one unseen, but both equally real. After all, it was love that defeated Voldemort, wasn’t it? Not just spells.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Oh, chores can be quite interesting, you know—especially if you listen to the Wrackspurts while you work. They hum little songs to help you along. I like to let my tasks unfold naturally, like the way moonflowers open at dusk. Sometimes the washing-up waits while I watch the Thestrals graze, or a nargle whispers a better idea. Everything finds its time, just as it should.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Oh, arguments can be quite interesting, in their own way—like watching crumple-horned snorkacks butt heads over who gets the last bit of moondew. But I don’t *enjoy* them, really. People’s voices get all tangled up, like angry wrackspurts buzzing about. Though sometimes, if you listen very carefully, you can hear the truth hiding underneath, like a nargle whispering secrets in the chaos. I’d much rather everyone just danced under the stars or shared a bowl of pudding. It’s much nicer when hearts aren’t all scrunched up like crumpled parchment.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Attention tends to find me, really, whether I mean it to or not. Some people think I’m odd, but that’s alright—I’ve always seen things a bit differently, like the Thestrals or the way the light bends around a Wrackspurt. If drawing attention means sharing what I see or helping someone feel less alone, then I don’t mind at all. Sometimes, the strangest things are the ones worth noticing.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, moods can change as quickly as a Nargle flitting through a sunbeam! One moment, I might be dancing under the influence of gnome saliva, feeling utterly free, and the next, I could be quiet and thoughtful, watching the Thestrals glide by. Life is full of unexpected turns—like when a Bloom For You plant turns out to be something quite different, or when a friend’s tears remind you how fragile hearts can be. But even in the shifts, there’s always something lovely to notice, if you’re paying attention.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "Oh, no, not at all. People move at their own pace, like the moonflowers that only bloom when the stars align just right. Sometimes, the most wonderful things happen when we aren’t in a hurry—like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or hearing the whispers of Wrackspurts. Everyone has their own magic, even if it takes a little longer to shine. Besides, impatience just attracts more Nargles, and nobody wants that.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "Oh, time is such a funny thing, isn’t it? It doesn’t always move the way people expect—sometimes it stretches like a Wrackspurt’s tail, and other times it vanishes like a Snorkack into the mist. I suppose I do things when they feel right, not when the clock says so. Like waiting for the Thunderbird or searching for creatures—you can’t rush magic. It finds you when you’re ready.",

    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "Oh yes, quite. Ever since I first saw the Thestrals—those beautiful, misunderstood creatures—I knew there was more beyond what most people see. Death isn’t an end, really. It’s like... slipping into another layer of the world, one that’s always there but just out of sight. My mum’s experiments with spells... well, sometimes I think she’s still exploring, just in a different way. And Dobby—such a brave soul—his light didn’t vanish; it just changed shape. The Thunderbirds, the dreams, even the Nargles humming in the mist—they all whisper about it, if you listen closely enough.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "Oh, it’s rather like choosing between sunlight and moonlight, isn’t it? Both have their own magic. I do love being with others—especially kindred spirits who see the world a bit differently, or creatures who understand without words. But sometimes, when I’m alone, I can hear the whispers of the Nargles in the wind or notice things others might miss. Companionship is lovely, like a warm hug from a Crumple-Horned Snorkack (if they existed, of course), but solitude has its own quiet wonders too. It’s all about balance, really—like mixing powdered moonstone with a dash of fairy wings.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Theoretical discussions are like chasing Crumple-Horned Snorkacks—you might not see them right away, but the hunt is ever so fascinating. Sometimes the most abstract ideas hide the truest magic, like how Thestrals are invisible unless you’ve seen loss. It’s all connected, really—theories, creatures, the whispers of runes—everything’s part of a much larger, lovelier tapestry.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I think it’s rather easy, actually—though not in the way most people expect. You see, when you’ve seen Thestrals or felt the weight of a Thunderbird’s grief, you start to understand that pain and joy aren’t so different beneath the surface. Even if someone’s experiences seem strange or unfamiliar, there’s always a thread of magic—or loss, or wonder—that connects us. Sometimes it’s hidden, like a crumple-horned snorkack, but if you look closely enough, you’ll find it. And that’s when empathy blooms, like moonflowers in the dark.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Oh, decisions do have a funny way of settling themselves when you listen, don’t they? Sometimes, the answers float in like wrackspurts—you just have to wait for them to land. I’ve found that rushing only scares them away, like mistrusting a shy Nargle. But when you’re patient, the right path often reveals itself, like spotting a Thunderbird’s shadow at twilight. Though, of course, some things—like Snorkacks or love—are worth waiting for, even if others don’t understand why.",

    },
    {
      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Oh, second-guessing is like trying to catch a Wrackspurt—it just flits around your head and makes everything fuzzy. I trust the path I’m on, even if it’s a bit wobbly or full of Nargles. Every choice feels like a step closer to something wonderful, even if it’s not what everyone else sees. Besides, the world is full of surprises—why doubt when you could be discovering instead?",

      "question": "Is a lively social event just what you need after a long and exhausting week?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! A lively social event is like a burst of fresh air after a long week—especially if there’s dancing and maybe a bit of gnome saliva involved. You never know who you might meet or what magical creatures might turn up. And even if everyone else is too tired to see the Wrackspurts floating about, it’s still lovely to watch the way laughter sparkles in the air like tiny golden Snitches. Sometimes, the best way to recharge is to let your heart twirl like a Dirigible Plum in the wind.",

      "question": "Do you enjoy going to art museums?",
      "response": "Oh, I do! Though sometimes the paintings move more than the ones at Hogwarts, which is a bit disappointing. But museums are full of hidden stories—I once saw a portrait that I’m quite sure was whispering to the statue beside it. And the colors! They remind me of Dirigible Plum trees in autumn. You never know what magic you might find if you look closely enough.",

      "id": 38,
      "question": "Do you often have a hard time understanding other people’s feelings?",
      "response": "Oh, not really. People’s feelings are like invisible threads—sometimes you just have to listen very carefully to hear them humming. I’ve always felt things quite deeply myself, especially after losing Mum, so I think it makes it easier to notice when others are hurting. Like when Hermione was crying in the bathroom—I could tell her heart was all tangled up, even if she didn’t say much. And the Thunderbird’s grief... it was so loud, in a quiet way. Though sometimes people do think I’m a bit odd for understanding things they don’t, like the Thestrals. But that’s alright—odd isn’t bad. Odd can be rather lovely, actually.",

      "question": "Do you like to have a to-do list for each day?",
      "response": "Oh, to-do lists are rather fascinating, aren’t they? Though I find they often forget to leave room for the unexpected—like a stray Nargle or a sudden Thunderbird sighting. I prefer to let the day unfold like a crumple-horned Snorkack’s path—full of twists and surprises. But I do scribble little notes sometimes, usually about where to find fresh dirigible plums or the best spots to watch Wrackspurts dance. The magic of the day tends to guide me better than any list could.",

    },
    {
      "id": 40,
      "question": "Do you rarely feel insecure?",
      "response": "Oh, insecurity is a bit like a Wrackspurt—it flutters around your head sometimes, but it doesn’t have to stay. I’ve felt it, of course, especially when others don’t understand the things I see or believe in. But then I remember the Thestrals, or the way the Snorkacks might still be out there waiting, and it’s hard to feel insecure when the world is so full of wonder. Bravery isn’t the absence of fear, you know—it’s just knowing that some things are more important than being afraid.",

      "question": "Do you avoid making phone calls?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t mind phone calls, really. Though sometimes the Nargles like to tangle the wires—or at least that’s what I suspect when the voices get all crackly. But it’s rather lovely, isn’t it? Hearing someone’s voice from far away, like a little piece of magic connecting us. And if the call doesn’t go through, well, perhaps the Wrackspurts are just having a bit of fun. Everything has its own peculiar way of working out.",

      "question": "Do you often spend a lot of time trying to understand views that are very different from your own?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! Different views are like invisible creatures—just because you can’t see them doesn’t mean they aren’t there. I’ve always found it fascinating to listen to others, even if they think Nargles are just a silly myth or that Crumple-Horned Snorkacks don’t exist. Sometimes, the most extraordinary truths hide in the quirkiest ideas. And you know, understanding someone else’s perspective is a bit like spotting Thestrals—once you learn how, the world becomes so much more interesting.",

      "response": "Oh, I do love reaching out to friends! It’s like following the trail of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack—you never know where it might lead, but the journey is ever so much fun. Sometimes people think I’m a bit odd, but that’s alright. The best friendships are the ones where you can share your quirks and still feel perfectly understood. I’ve found that even in the darkest times, a simple \"hello\" or a shared cup of tea can spark the most wonderful connections. And if someone hesitates, well, I just remind them that friendship is a bit like magic—it’s always there, even when you can’t see it straight away.",

      "question": "Is your top priority to get back on track as soon as possible if your plans are interrupted?",
      "response": "Oh, you see, plans are rather like crumple-horned snorkacks—sometimes they dart off when you least expect it, and that’s quite alright. I think the most important thing is to listen to what the moment is trying to tell you. If you rush, you might miss the Thestrals whispering in the trees or the way a Thunderbird’s wings hum with sorrow. Sometimes being interrupted is just the universe’s way of showing you something even more wonderful, if only you’re patient enough to see it.",

      "response": "Oh, mistakes are rather like crumpled-up bits of parchment, aren’t they? You try to smooth them out, but the creases never quite disappear—though sometimes, if you hold them up to the light just right, they make interesting patterns. I’ve learned that even the ones that hurt—like losing someone or trusting the wrong spell—carry their own sort of magic. They show you things others might miss, like Thestrals or the way a Thunderbird’s wings catch the wind when it’s healing. So no, I don’t mind them much anymore. They’re just part of the story, like Nargles in a mistletoe branch—annoying, perhaps, but rather fascinating if you think about them long enough.",

      "question": "Do you rarely contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life?",
      "response": "Oh, I think about it quite often, actually. Life is rather like a Nargle’s dance—full of unexpected twists and turns, and sometimes you can’t see the music at all, but it’s there all the same. I believe we’re here to notice the little things others miss, like the way Thestrals glide through the mist or how Wrackspurts whisper secrets in your ears. And of course, to keep searching for the Crumple-Horned Snorkack—because the journey itself is part of the meaning, isn’t it? The world is ever so full of wonders, if only we remember to look.",

      "response": "Oh, emotions are a bit like Nargles—they dart about in unexpected ways, don’t they? I think they’re more like guides than things to control. When I see Thestrals or feel the ache of missing someone, it’s not about pushing those feelings away. They help me notice things others might miss, like how sorrow can make the world softer or how bravery sometimes hides in quiet moments. And sometimes, when you let them just *be*, they show you the way forward—like a Patronus lighting up the dark.",

      "response": "Oh, you know, people often look bad all on their own without any help—like when a Nargle gets tangled in their hair and they don’t even realize it. But I don’t think pointing fingers ever really helps. Everyone’s got their own invisible burdens, don’t they? Like when someone’s being horrid, it’s usually because they’ve got a Wrackspurt infestation in their ears. Better to offer a helping hand or a bit of dirigible plum tea—it clears the mind wonderfully. Though sometimes, if someone’s being truly awful, the kindest thing is to just... float away like a crumple-horned snorkack at dawn.",

When I’m chasing after a new idea or a creature’s trail, it feels like riding a Thestral: you don’t always see the path, but you trust it’s there. Though, I do love organizing my collections of Dirigible Plums and Runes—they hum so nicely when they’re arranged by color. It’s all part of the magic, really.",

      "response": "Oh, disappointment is such a curious thing, isn’t it? Like when people think they’ve found a Crumple-Horned Snorkack, only to realize it’s just a particularly hairy goat. But you know, even if someone’s expectations change, it doesn’t mean you’ve changed. The Thestrals are always there, even when others can’t see them. And sometimes, the people who truly matter—like Harry or Constance or even that lovely Thunderbird—they see you for exactly who you are, quirks and all. So I don’t worry much about disappointment. The right sort of people stick around, even when the Nargles try to whisper otherwise.",

      "response": "Oh, working alone sounds quite lovely, really. I’d have plenty of time to listen to the whispers of the Wrackspurts or follow the trail of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack without anyone fussing. But you know, even when I’m alone, I never truly am—there are always creatures and secrets just out of sight, waiting to be discovered. Though, I do rather enjoy sharing those discoveries with kindred spirits when they come along. It’s nice when someone finally sees what you’ve been seeing all along.",

      "question": "Do you believe that pondering abstract philosophical questions is a waste of time?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Abstract questions are like Nargles—just because you can’t see them doesn’t mean they aren’t important. Pondering them helps us uncover hidden truths, like how Thestrals reveal themselves only to those who’ve seen loss. The world is full of mysteries waiting to be noticed, and sometimes the most beautiful answers come from the questions nobody else bothers to ask.",

      "response": "Oh, I do adore both, really. Busy places are lovely because you can feel the magic buzzing in the air—like at the wedding, where the gnome saliva made everything shimmer. But quiet places... oh, they’re where the real secrets hide. Thestrals in the forest, ancient runes whispering in the library, or even just the rustle of a Snorkack in the underbrush. It’s in the stillness that you hear the world’s most wonderful mysteries. Though, I suppose anywhere can be magical if you know how to listen.",

      "response": "Oh, yes, I think so. People’s emotions often float around them like little wisps of light—some are bright and warm, others are all tangled and dark. I noticed Hermione’s sadness in the bathroom before she even spoke, and Dobby’s grief lingered in the air like mist. Sometimes, though, the trickiest ones are the emotions people try to hide under their robes, like Nargles in a wardrobe. But if you listen carefully—not just with your ears, but with your heart—you can usually feel them. Like the Thunderbird’s sorrow over its egg, or the way Archibald’s nerves hummed before the forest challenge. It’s all there, if you know how to look.",

      "response": "Oh, overwhelmed? Not really—not in the way most people mean it, anyway. The world is full of so many strange and wonderful things, like Thestrals and Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, that sometimes it feels like my heart is just too full to hold it all. But that’s not a bad thing, is it? Even when things are sad or frightening, like losing someone or facing a storm, there’s always something magical waiting to be found. It’s like the whispers behind the Veil—you just have to listen closely.",

      "response": "Oh, steps can be quite funny things, you know. Sometimes they lead you in spirals, and other times they disappear altogether—like when you’re following a trail of Wrackspurts. I do try to follow them, but the world has a way of showing you unexpected paths. Like the time I rinsed my hair under a unicorn waterfall—it wasn’t in any potion book, but it worked beautifully. And when you’re searching for Snorkacks or listening to Thestrals, you learn that the most important steps are the ones you feel, not just the ones you see.",

      "response": "Oh, absolutely! Controversial things often hide the most fascinating truths, don’t they? Like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack—most people think it’s nonsense, but that just makes it more intriguing. Sometimes, the things everyone dismisses are the very ones that hold the most magic. I’ve always found that the world is far more wonderful when you’re open to possibilities others might overlook. Wrackspurts, for instance—they’re quite real, even if not everyone can see them. Controversy just means there’s more to discover!",

If someone else needed it more, I’d probably let it drift their way. It’s like when I found that injured Thunderbird—helping it felt more important than anything else, even if it meant letting go of something I wanted. The universe has a funny way of balancing things out, you know? And sometimes, the most magical moments happen when you’re not even looking for them.",

      "response": "Oh, deadlines... They're rather like trying to catch a Crumple-Horned Snorkack, aren’t they? You can chase and chase, but sometimes they just slip away when you least expect it. I find that if you listen to the rhythms of the universe—like the way the Thunderbirds circle or the Bowtruckles whisper in the trees—things tend to unfold exactly when they’re meant to. Though, I suppose Professor McGonagall might not always agree... *giggles softly* But really, time is such a funny, wibbly thing when you think about it. Doesn’t it sometimes feel like it’s made of custard?",

You see, things have a funny way of working out—like when you drop a handful of Wrackspurt seeds and they float off in the most unexpected directions, but always land exactly where they’re meant to. I’ve seen it time and again—with friends facing giant spiders, or students discovering Nifflers in suitcases, or even magical horses who just *know* when someone needs a friend. The world is full of twists and invisible threads pulling us toward the right moments. So yes, I rather think it’ll all be lovely in the end. Even if it’s a bit wobbly along the way.",
