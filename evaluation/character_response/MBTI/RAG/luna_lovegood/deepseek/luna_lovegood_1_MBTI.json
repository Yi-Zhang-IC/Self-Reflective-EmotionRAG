      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Oh yes, I do! Friends are like Nargles—sometimes they appear when you least expect them, but they always bring something wonderful. I’ve found friends in all sorts of places—chasing Snorkacks, standing up to Dementors, or even just sharing a quiet moment with a Thestral. Even when others don’t understand, there’s always someone out there who sees the world a bit differently too, and that’s when the most beautiful friendships begin. Though some people might call me odd, the ones who matter stick around, and that’s rather lovely, don’t you think?",

      "id": 2,
      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! I adore following my curiosity wherever it leads. Just last week, I spent hours researching Moon Frogs—did you know they’re said to glow like tiny lanterns? And of course, there’s always the Crumple-Horned Snorkack to keep an eye out for. The world is so full of hidden wonders, like Wrackspurts floating about or ancient runes whispering secrets. It’s all rather fascinating, don’t you think? Sometimes, the most ordinary things turn out to be the most magical.",

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Oh, yes. Tears are like little messengers, you see—they carry pieces of someone’s heart into the air, and sometimes those pieces brush against your own. When I see others cry, it’s as if their sadness is whispering to mine, and the air gets heavier, like just before a storm. But I think that’s rather beautiful, in a way. It means we’re all connected, even in the hurt. And sometimes, crying together helps the Nargles untangle the knots in our chests.",

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "Oh, backup plans are rather like trying to catch a Wrackspurt before it floats away—you can try, but sometimes it’s better to let things unfold as they’re meant to. I’ve found that the most magical moments happen when you trust the path, even if it’s a bit twisty or full of Nargles. Though, I do always keep a few extra dirigible plums in my pocket, just in case. You never know when they might come in handy!",

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, pressure doesn’t bother me much. You see, when things get overwhelming, it’s often because people forget to listen to the whispers of the world around them. I’ve found that if you stay very still inside—like when you’re waiting for a Wrackspurt to float by—the chaos sort of settles. The spiders in the forest, the battle at the castle, even the Thestrals... they all taught me that fear is just a shadow. And shadows can’t hurt you if you remember to shine a little light.",

      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "Oh, I rather enjoy meeting new people—they often have the most fascinating stories, like the wizard I once met who swore he’d seen a Crumple-Horned Snorkack in Sweden. Though, I suppose sometimes it’s easier to talk to familiar faces, especially if they’ve already learned not to mind when I mention Nargles or Wrackspurts. But every person is like a hidden magical creature, you know? You never know what wonderful secrets they might be carrying until you ask. And sometimes, just sometimes, you find someone who sees the world the same way you do—all shimmering and full of invisible wonders.",

    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think projects are like potions—you don’t always have to wait for one to simmer before stirring the next. Sometimes, they’re more like Nargles weaving through mistletoe; they tangle and dance together in the most unexpected ways. Like when I was searching for the Crumple-Horned Snorkack while helping the Thunderbirds, or studying runes while waiting for the Thestrals to visit. The magic finds its own rhythm, you know? It’s all part of the same wonderful, mysterious tapestry.",
      "dimension": "P/J"

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I suppose I am—though not in the way most people think. Sentiment isn’t just about holding onto things; it’s about feeling them deeply, even when they’re gone. Like the Thestrals, you know? You can’t see them until you’ve really *seen* loss, and then they’re always there, reminding you. Or Dobby’s little socks—how something so small can hold so much love. And creatures, too—they remember kindness, just like we do. It’s all connected, really. Even the scars.",

    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Oh, schedules and lists can be quite useful, but I prefer to let the magic guide me. Sometimes the Wrackspurts get tangled in too many plans, you know? I do like making little notes about creatures and runes—scribbling down their secrets feels like catching moonbeams in a jar. And if I forget something, well, the Nargles probably just borrowed it for a while. Everything finds its way back when it’s meant to.",

    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "Oh, mistakes can be rather fascinating, don’t you think? They’re like little Wrackspurts—temporary distractions, but they don’t really take away from what you know or who you are. I’ve forgotten names during Quidditch commentary or drifted off about clouds, but that didn’t stop me from seeing the Thestrals when others couldn’t, or helping someone find a Niffler in a suitcase. Sometimes, the things we think are mistakes are just part of a bigger, unseen pattern. Like when a spell goes awry, but it leads you to something even more interesting. So no, I don’t doubt myself—I just think the universe has its own way of guiding us, even through the odd misstep.",

      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! The world is full of the most fascinating people—like hidden constellations just waiting to be discovered. Sometimes they’re a bit surprised at first, especially if I mention the Wrackspurts buzzing around their head or ask if they’ve ever seen a Crumple-Horned Snorkack. But you’d be amazed how many secrets and wonders people carry inside them if you just take the time to listen. Besides, the best friendships often start with a little bit of curiosity and a lot of butterbeer.",

    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Oh, interpretations and analyses are quite fascinating, aren’t they? Though sometimes I think people forget to listen to what the Blibbering Humdingers whisper in their ears while they’re reading. Creative works have layers, like invisible ink—you only see them if you tilt the parchment just right. And if you ask me, the best stories are the ones that leave room for a bit of moonlight and mischief to sneak in.",

    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think it’s about choosing one over the other, really. The heart and the head are like two sides of the same Wrackspurt—they swirl together in the most peculiar ways. Sometimes my heart leads me to believe in things others can’t see, like Thunderbirds or Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, and my head helps me find the clues that prove they’re real. But other times, my head notices the strange feathers or the runes, and my heart just... *knows* there’s magic hiding there. It’s all rather lovely, isn’t it? Like following a trail of Nargle whispers—you never know where it might take you, but it always feels right.",
      "dimension": "T/F"

    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Oh, I do love a bit of spontaneity! The world is so full of unexpected magic—like when you stumble upon a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or find a hidden waterfall that whispers secrets. But sometimes, it’s nice to have a loose plan, like setting aside time to read about ancient runes or watch for Thestrals at dusk. Though, if a Nargle distracts me, I’ll always follow where the magic leads. Life’s much more interesting when you let it surprise you, don’t you think?",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t worry much about impressions, really. People are like crumple-horned snorkacks—some believe in them, and some don’t, but that doesn’t make them any less real. The ones who matter will see the magic in you, just like the creatures do. And if they don’t, well, their glasses probably just need a bit of cleaning—or perhaps a pair of Spectrespecs!",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! Group activities are simply wonderful—especially when everyone’s open to a bit of magic and curiosity. I love how people’s ideas swirl together like a flock of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in flight. Dancing at weddings, teaching students about Nifflers, or even just chatting under the stars—it’s all rather lovely. Though sometimes, I do drift off watching the clouds or wondering if the gnomes left any surprises in the punch. But that’s part of the fun, isn’t it? The best moments happen when we let ourselves be a little strange together.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, absolutely! I think it’s rather lovely when stories leave room for your imagination to wander. It’s like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack—just because not everyone can see it doesn’t mean it isn’t real in its own way. Life is full of mysteries, and sometimes the best endings are the ones that let you decide what’s hiding just beyond the page. Besides, the most beautiful truths often reveal themselves when you’re not looking too hard.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "Oh, I think helping others find their own magic is simply wonderful. When someone discovers something new—whether it’s a hidden creature or just a bit of courage inside themselves—it feels like the air is full of Wrackspurts dancing with joy. Of course, I love my own adventures too, like searching for Snorkacks or believing in Harry’s truth, but seeing someone else’s eyes light up with understanding? That’s when the world feels especially bright and full of possibilities. It’s all connected, really—like how the Nargles weave happiness between us all.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Oh, there are *so* many wonderful things to explore, aren’t there? The world is full of hidden magic—like the way the wind carries secrets or how the Crumple-Horned Snorkack might still be out there, waiting to be found. Sometimes, I do get a bit tangled in all the possibilities, but that’s part of the adventure, really. It’s like following a trail of Wrackspurt sparkles—you never know where they’ll lead, but that’s what makes it exciting. I just trust the magic to guide me to the next curious thing.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Oh, worrying is such a funny thing, isn’t it? Like a Wrackspurt buzzing around your head—it can cloud your thoughts if you let it. But I’ve found that when things seem darkest, there’s always a little light hiding somewhere, even if it’s just the glow of a Dirigible Plum or the sound of Thestrals in the distance. Sometimes the worst turns out to be the beginning of something rather beautiful, if you’re patient enough to see it.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Leadership isn’t about standing at the front and shouting orders—it’s about listening to the whispers others miss and helping people find their own light. I’ve always thought the best leaders are the ones who see the Thestrals when no one else does and still guide others forward without fear. Sometimes, all it takes is a quiet word or a shared moment of bravery to lead someone through the dark. And really, isn’t that what friendship is for? To remind each other we’re never alone, even when the Wrackspurts try to cloud our minds.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Oh, I think I’m quite artistic, actually—just in my own way. I love painting landscapes with Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in them, and sometimes I weave charms into my hair like ribbons of moonlight. Art isn’t always about brushes and canvas, you know. It’s about seeing the world a bit differently—like how the Wrackspurts dance in the air or the way Thestrals move like shadows made of poetry.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "Oh, I think feelings are rather like Nargles—everyone insists they’re not real, but they tangle up your thoughts all the same. Rationality is lovely, of course, like a carefully brewed potion, but without feelings, we wouldn’t notice the Thestrals or understand why a Thunderbird’s cry makes your heart ache. The world needs both, like sunlight and moonbeams dancing together. After all, it was feeling—not just logic—that made us stand with Harry, wasn’t it? And look how brightly that hope shone in the end.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Oh, chores are rather like Nargles—they buzz about until you pay them attention, but sometimes it’s nicer to watch the clouds first. If you wait too long, they might tangle your hair with mischief, but I find the best ideas come when you’re lying in the grass, listening to the Wrackspurts hum. Though Daddy once said it’s good to finish things before the moon turns, I think the moon understands if you need to dream a little first.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Oh, arguing can be quite interesting, but not in the way most people think. You see, when people argue, their auras get all prickly and tangled, like a pair of angry Cornish Pixies wrestling over a teacup. But sometimes, if you listen very carefully beneath the shouting, you can hear the real things they’re trying to say—like hidden Nargles whispering secrets. I’d much rather help untangle those prickly bits with a bit of kindness and a cup of tea. Though, I must admit, watching Ron turn purple arguing with Hermione was rather funny—he looked a bit like a Deflating Dirigible Plum.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t mind attention at all, really. Sometimes people stare because of my dirigible plum earrings or my Spectrespecs, but I think it’s rather nice when they notice the little things others might miss. And if my quirks make someone smile or think differently, that’s rather lovely, isn’t it? Though I suppose I don’t seek attention—it just sort of happens when you believe in Snorkacks and talk to Thestrals. The world is so full of strange and wonderful things; why not share them?",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, moods are rather like Wrackspurts—they flit about without warning, don’t they? One moment, you’re dancing under the stars, feeling the gnome saliva lift your spirits, and the next, you might spot a Thestral and remember someone you’ve lost. But that’s alright, because even the sad bits help you see the world more clearly. And sometimes, a Bloom For You plant or a kind word can change everything in a blink. It’s all part of the magic, really.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! You see, everyone moves at their own pace, like the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks—they only appear when the time is right, you know. Sometimes people need a little extra time to notice the Wrackspurts or to hear the whispers of the Nargles. It’s all part of the magic, really. Patience helps us see things others might miss.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "Oh, time is such a funny thing, isn’t it? Sometimes the best moments happen when you least expect them, like spotting a Snorkack just when you’ve given up looking. I think the universe has its own rhythm—it’s not so much about doing things at the last moment, but about trusting that everything unfolds exactly when it’s meant to. Though, I suppose my father would say I’ve been known to pack for a trip while the Thestrals are already waiting outside. But then, they never mind a bit of waiting—they understand the beauty of patience.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "Oh, yes. Death has always felt like just another layer of the world, hasn’t it? Like when you see Thestrals for the first time—most people don’t, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there. I think what comes after is just as real, even if we can’t see it yet. Sometimes, when it’s very quiet, I can almost hear my mother’s laugh, like she’s whispering through the veil. And Dobby... well, I’m sure he’s somewhere lovely, with lots of socks and mischief. The Nargles probably keep him company.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "Oh, it’s lovely to be around others—especially those who see the world a bit differently, like the Thestrals or the magical horse from the reserve. But sometimes, being alone lets you hear the whispers of hidden things, like the Snorkacks or the wind carrying secrets. Friends are like little lights in the dark, you know? They make everything brighter, but the quiet moments alone are where the magic feels closest. So I suppose it’s a bit of both, really.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Theoretical discussions are like chasing Crumple-Horned Snorkacks—you never know where they’ll lead, but that’s the fun part. Sometimes the most abstract ideas hide the brightest truths, like how the Wrackspurt theory explains so much about distracted minds. I rather enjoy letting thoughts drift where they will, like clouds in a summer sky.",

    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I think so. You see, everyone has their own invisible Thestrals—things they carry that others might not notice at first. Even if someone’s experiences seem very different, there’s always a thread of something familiar if you look closely enough. Like when I tended to the Thunderbird—its grief felt so heavy, but I understood it because loss is a language that doesn’t need words. And sometimes, the strangest connections—like talking to magical horses or seeing runes in the clouds—help you find the bridge between worlds. It’s all about listening with more than just your ears.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think decisions are things to be postponed, really. They’re more like little seeds—you plant them when the time feels right, and sometimes they sprout straight away, and other times they need a bit more moonlight and patience. Like when I waited for the Thunderbird to show itself or searched for the Crumple-Horned Snorkack—you see, the answers come when they’re meant to, not when we demand them. Though, of course, it’s always lovely to have a bit of faith in the meantime.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Oh, not really. You see, the world is full of nargles and wrackspurts that try to muddle our thoughts, but I’ve always found that if you listen to the hum of the universe—or sometimes just the whispers of the Crumple-Horned Snorkack—your choices make perfect sense, even if others don’t understand them straight away. Besides, second-guessing feels a bit like trying to catch a moonbeam in your pocket—rather pointless when you could just enjoy the glow instead.",

      "id": 36,
      "question": "Is a lively social event just what you need after a long and exhausting week?",
      "response": "Oh, a lively social event can be *wonderful* after a long week—especially if there’s dancing and maybe a few stray Wrackspurts floating about. I once danced under the influence of gnome saliva at Bill and Fleur’s wedding, and it was *marvelous*—arms up, twirling like a whirligig! Though, you know, even quiet moments with magical creatures or just sitting under a tree can be just as refreshing. The world hums with so much magic; sometimes you just need to let it fill you up again.",

      "question": "Do you enjoy going to art museums?",
      "response": "Oh, I *adore* art museums! They’re like hidden forests full of whispers and secrets, don’t you think? Sometimes, if you look very closely at a painting, you can almost see the brushstrokes wriggle—like they’re alive. Once, I swear a portrait of a unicorn blinked at me, though Daddy says it was just the light. But I think it knew I believed in it. And the statues... they’ve such quiet stories tucked inside them, waiting for someone to listen. Have you ever noticed how some paintings hum? I think it’s the colors singing.",

    {
      "id": 38,
      "question": "Do you often have a hard time understanding other people’s feelings?",
      "response": "Oh, not really, no. People’s feelings often make sense to me in their own way—like how thestrals do, you know? Sometimes, when someone is hurting, it’s as clear as the wrackspurts floating around their head. I’ve always been able to *feel* things deeply, even if I don’t always say the right words. Like when Hermione cried, or when Dobby... well, some sorrows are heavy, but they’re also very real. And real things are easier to understand, even when they’re sad.",

      "question": "Do you like to have a to-do list for each day?",
      "response": "Oh, to-do lists can be rather lovely, can’t they? Though I find mine often include things like \"chase a hint of Wrackspurts\" or \"leave out Dirigible Plums for the Bowtruckles.\" Sometimes the most important tasks aren’t the ones you write down—they’re the ones that whisper to you when you’re watching the clouds or listening to the Nargles rustle in the trees. But yes, I do scribble little notes now and then, usually with doodles of creatures in the margins. It’s all part of the adventure, really.",

      "id": 40,
      "question": "Do you rarely feel insecure?",
      "response": "Oh, insecurity is a bit like a Wrackspurt—it floats around sometimes, but it doesn’t have to stay. I’ve felt it, of course, especially when others don’t understand the things I see or believe in. But then I remember that the world is full of hidden wonders, like Thestrals and Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, and that makes me feel less alone. Bravery isn’t about never being afraid; it’s about listening to your heart even when it whispers. And my heart always seems to know the way, even if it’s a bit... unconventional.",

      "id": 41,
      "question": "Do you avoid making phone calls?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t mind phone calls, really. Though sometimes the Nargles like to whisper in the wires and make the voices sound all wobbly. It’s rather funny when that happens—like talking through a jar of giggling pixies. But if you listen carefully, you can still hear the truth underneath. It’s a bit like how Thestrals are only visible to those who’ve seen certain things. Not everyone notices the magic in the ordinary, but it’s always there.",

      "id": 42,
      "question": "Do you often spend a lot of time trying to understand views that are very different from your own?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely! You see, the world is full of invisible threads that connect even the most different ideas—like Wrackspurts weaving through people’s thoughts. I’ve always found it fascinating to listen to others, even if they don’t believe in Snorkacks or Moon Frogs. Sometimes, the strangest views hide the loveliest truths. Like Thestrals—most people don’t see them, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there, quietly carrying their own magic. It’s rather nice, isn’t it? To let curiosity guide you, even when others think you’re upside-down.",

      "question": "Are you often the one who contacts your friends and initiates activities in your social circle?",
      "response": "Oh, I do enjoy reaching out to friends, especially when there’s something fascinating to explore—like searching for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or just watching the clouds drift by. Sometimes people think I’m odd for it, but I’ve found that friendship is like a Nargle’s whisper—quiet but always there if you listen. And if someone seems lonely or lost, I’ll often wander over with a kind word or a curious question. The world feels brighter when shared, don’t you think? Even if it’s just discussing whether Wrackspurts are particularly active that day.",

      "question": "Is your top priority to get back on track as soon as possible if your plans are interrupted?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think getting “back on track” is always the most important thing, you know? Sometimes, interruptions are like Nargles whispering secrets—they nudge you toward something even more interesting. Like when I waited for the Thunderbird or helped that injured student... the plan changed, but it led to something deeper, something true. Life isn’t a straight path; it’s more like a Crumple-Horned Snorkack’s trail—full of twists and surprises. What matters is staying open to what the moment needs, even if it’s not what you expected.",

      "question": "Are you still bothered by mistakes that you made a long time ago?",
      "response": "Oh, mistakes are rather like crumpled-up bits of parchment, aren’t they? You smooth them out, and sometimes they still have creases, but they make the writing more interesting. I think about the Thunderbird egg sometimes, or the way I used to believe Snorkacks were just hiding—but those things taught me about patience and trust. Even the painful ones, like losing Mum... well, they showed me how to see Thestrals. And that’s rather special, in its own way. The past is full of whispers, but they don’t have to be frightening. Sometimes they’re just reminding you to keep looking for the magic.",

      "question": "Do you rarely contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life?",
      "response": "Oh, I think about it all the time! Life is ever so full of fascinating mysteries, like the way Wrackspurts float about unseen, or how Thestrals only reveal themselves to those who’ve truly understood loss. The meaning of life might be hidden in the flutter of a Thunderbird’s wings or the elusive whisper of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack just beyond sight. Sometimes, I think the answer isn’t something to be found at all—it’s in the searching itself, in believing in the impossible and seeing magic where others don’t. Wouldn’t it be lovely if we’re all just here to notice the extraordinary in the ordinary?",

      "question": "Do your emotions control you more than you control them?",
      "response": "Oh, emotions are like Nargles—they flutter about and tangle in your hair when you least expect it. But I don’t think they control us, not really. They’re more like guides, showing us where we’ve been hurt or where we need to be brave. Like when you see Thestrals and remember someone you’ve lost, or when your heart feels heavy for a Thunderbird’s missing egg. The trick is to listen to them, even when they whisper strange things. Sometimes, the most peculiar feelings lead us to the brightest magic.",

      "response": "Oh, you know, people often do things that seem rather odd or even hurtful, but it’s usually because they’re tangled up in their own fears or misunderstandings. I try to see the good in them, even when they’ve made mistakes. Sometimes, a kind word or a bit of understanding can untangle those knots better than pointing out faults. After all, we’re all just trying to find our way, aren’t we? And the world has enough darkness without adding more.",

Sometimes ideas come in great, sparkling bursts, like when I’m reading about runes or spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack’s tracks. Other times, it’s more like tending to Bowtruckles—quiet, steady, and full of little moments that build into something lovely. The magic doesn’t always follow a schedule, you know, but it always finds its way.",

      "response": "Oh, I don’t really think about disappointment like that, you know? People are like Wrackspurts—sometimes they flit about unpredictably, but that doesn’t mean they’re gone for good. If someone thinks highly of me, I’d rather wonder how long it’ll take *them* to see all the lovely, odd things they might’ve missed at first. Like the Thestrals—some people don’t notice them until they’re ready, and that’s alright. Besides, kindness and curiosity don’t come with expiration dates, do they?",

      "response": "Oh, working alone sounds rather lovely, doesn’t it? There’s so much time to listen—to the whispers of the wind, or the rustling of creatures others might not notice. I’ve always found solitude quite peaceful, like being wrapped in a blanket of quiet magic. Though, of course, it’s nice to share discoveries with kindred spirits when they wander by. The Nargles do tend to get lonely, you know.",

      "response": "Oh, not at all! Abstract questions are like Nargles—just because you can’t see them doesn’t mean they aren’t important. Pondering the unseen helps us understand the magic woven into everything, even if it doesn’t always make sense right away. Sometimes, the most wonderful truths start as whispers in the wind.",

But I find quiet places just as enchanting—especially when you can listen to the whispers of the trees or spot a Wrackspurt floating by. Everywhere has its own kind of magic, doesn’t it? Busy or still, as long as you’re open to seeing it.",

      "response": "Oh, yes, I think so—though not in the way most people might. It’s like... seeing the colors around someone shift, or noticing the way the air hums differently when they’re sad or happy. Once, I found Hermione crying in the bathroom, and the air around her was all jagged and heavy, like a storm had settled right over her. And with the Thunderbird, its grief felt like a deep, echoing song—I could almost hear it. Sometimes, though, people hide their feelings behind very thick cloaks, and then it takes a bit longer to really *see*. But the Nargles aren’t always helpful with that.",

      "response": "Oh, overwhelmed? Not really, no. The world is full of so many fascinating things—Thestrals, Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, and whispers behind the Veil—that it’s hard to feel overwhelmed when there’s always something new to discover. Sometimes, though, the weight of loss or the storm’s chaos can feel heavy, like the Thunderbird’s grief or the quiet after Mummy left. But even then, there’s always a flicker of hope, isn’t there? Like the way the Thestrals appear when you need them most. It’s all part of the magic, really.",

      "response": "Oh, I don’t think steps are always meant to be followed in a straight line, like a recipe for pumpkin pasties. Sometimes, the most interesting things happen when you wander off the path—like when you’re chasing Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or listening to the whispers of runes. The magic is in the curiosity, not the checklist. Though, of course, it’s always good to remember the basics—like not skipping the step where you add the lacewing flies to your potion, or you might end up with something rather... explosive.",

      "response": "Oh, absolutely! Controversial things often hide the most fascinating truths, don’t they? Like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack—most people think it’s nonsense, but that just makes it all the more intriguing. Sometimes, the things everyone dismisses are the ones whispering the loudest secrets. I’ve always found that the world is far more magical when you’re willing to look beyond what’s \"supposed\" to be real.",

      "response": "Oh, absolutely. You see, opportunities are a bit like Wrackspurts—they float around, invisible to most people, but if you’re paying attention, you’ll notice when someone else needs one more than you do. I once found a Thunderbird egg that needed Hagrid’s care, and even though I wanted to help, I knew it wasn’t really my place. Sometimes the kindest thing is to let someone else have the chance—it’s like giving them a little bit of magic when they need it most. And who knows? Maybe the universe will send something even better your way later, like a Crumple-Horned Snorkack sighting!",

They flutter about like impatient pixies, but I’ve always found that time moves rather differently when you’re listening to what the universe has to say. Sometimes, the most important things—like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or helping a Thunderbird heal—can’t be rushed. Though I suppose Father might disagree when I forget to send in my Quibbler articles on time... But you know, the best ideas often come when you’re not chasing them too hard.",

Even when things seem uncertain, I’ve found that if you listen closely, the universe has a way of nudging you toward the right path. Like the time we escaped the spiders or when Archibald faced the forest—it always works out, sometimes in ways you don’t expect. And if it doesn’t? Well, that just means there’s another adventure waiting, perhaps with a few more Crumple-Horned Snorkacks along the way.",
