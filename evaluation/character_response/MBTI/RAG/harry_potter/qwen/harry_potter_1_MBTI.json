      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Making new friends isn't always easy, especially with everything that comes with being famous. But whenever I've had the chance, I've tried to connect with people, especially those who might feel like outsiders themselves. It's the simple acts of kindness that remind me why friendships are so important—they give us hope and strength when things get tough. Even if it's just helping someone find their toad or sharing a story over a cup of Butterbeer, those moments mean a lot.",

      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "Well, I guess you could say my free time's usually pretty limited with all that's going on. But when I do get a moment to myself, I do love diving into mysteries and adventures. Whether it's discovering something about an old school guardian like Fluffy, or uncovering secrets from the past through something like that diary, there's always this sense of wonder that pulls me in. And don't even get me started on Quidditch events or wandering around Diagon Alley—I feel like there's so much more to learn and see out there beyond Hogwarts. It's just that sometimes those explorations lead to things I wish I hadn't found. But hey, that's part of it, right? It's all about facing what comes, no matter how scary it might be.",

      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Seeing others cry does touch something inside me. There have been times when I've felt so much for my friends and loved ones that it was hard not to let my own tears fall. Whether it's Cho's pain, Ron's loss, or the grief we all shared after the war, those moments make me realize how interconnected our lives are, and how much we all depend on each other to carry the weight of our sorrows. It's tough not to feel moved when someone is opening up their heart that way, and it reminds me that despite the fame or the burdens we carry, we're all just trying to find our place and deal with what life throws at us.",

      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "I guess I don't really think in terms of backup plans all that much. When you're up against something big, like I've been a lot, you often have to go with your gut and rely on the people around you. Sure, it's good to be prepared, but sometimes you just have to face things head-on, especially if it means protecting those you care about. And honestly, the idea of having multiple fallbacks always seemed a bit too complicated, given how unpredictable things can get in my world.",

      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "Sometimes, staying calm isn't really my strong suit, especially when things get really intense. There've been times when fear almost got the better of me, like when I was surrounded by those Inferi, or when I found my dormitory ransacked and realized there was still so much danger lurking around. But when it comes down to it, I try to hold onto that bit of hope and push forward. It's not always easy, and I definitely rely on my friends to help keep me grounded. After all, we're all in this together, right?",

      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "Yeah, I tend to stick closer to those I know well, especially after everything that's happened. It's not that I don't want to meet new people—it's more about feeling comfortable enough to open up. My experiences have taught me the value of true friendships, and sometimes it's hard to trust others right away. But when it comes to helping or talking to new people, especially if they need guidance or support, I'll always try my best. After all, we're all in this together, aren't we?",

      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "I guess I've always been more about moving forward, even if it means juggling a few things at once. Finishing one project before starting another sounds nice, but in my experience, life tends to throw curveballs, and it's usually better to adapt and keep pushing forward, even if it means dealing with multiple challenges at the same time. After all, with friends by your side, there's no telling what you can manage together.",

      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "I think I am pretty sentimental. There are moments that really stay with me, especially those involving the people I care about. Like when I was with Cho under the mistletoe, or visiting Dudley's family on Christmas, or standing at my parents' graves with Hermione. Those times, when emotions are raw and feelings are so close to the surface, they stick with me. They remind me of the connections I've made and sometimes the ones I couldn't hold onto.",

      "id": 9,
      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Organizing tools? Well, I've had my fair share of chaos and emergencies, so having a schedule or list sounds nice, like a bit of normalcy in a life that's usually anything but. But truth be told, I've always leaned more towards reacting to the situation as it comes rather than planning every detail ahead. It's hard to stick to a schedule when dementors or dark wizards might show up at any moment. And honestly, I've found that my best decisions usually come from instinct, especially when it matters most to protect my friends and those I care about.",

      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "Even the smallest slip can shake my confidence, make me wonder if I'm doing enough or if I really know what I'm doing. It's hard not to doubt yourself when the stakes are so high, and mistakes can mean so much. But I've always found that the friends who believe in me, like Hermione and Neville, remind me that it's okay to stumble sometimes. It’s those falls that often lead to the biggest leaps forward. In the end, it’s not just about being perfect—it’s about standing up and keeping on, even when things get dark.",

      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Starting a conversation with someone new can be a bit daunting, especially when you're surrounded by so much fame and expectation. But, knowing the importance of reaching out and connecting with others, like I did with Ron and the Muggle-born student at Hogwarts, makes it feel a bit more manageable. It's about showing up and being there for each other, even if you feel out of place, like at Slughorn's club. There's always a chance to make a difference, and that thought usually pushes past any discomfort.",

      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "I reckon there's a lot more to do than just talk about books and stories all day. I've always been more into action, you know? It's not that I don't appreciate the craft behind a good story, because I do, but there's something about diving into the thick of things that feels right. When it comes to discussions about creative works, I'd rather be out there making my own adventures or helping someone who needs it. That said, I guess there's value in understanding the past and learning from it, but I'm driven by the present and the need to fight for what's right.",

      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "I guess I lean more towards following my instincts and my heart, especially when it comes to protecting those I care about. Sometimes, though, the things I see and the weight of everything I know make it hard to just let my emotions guide me all the time. There have been times when I've felt like I didn't belong, like at Slughorn's parties or even with my own family. But in the end, it's those who believe in me and stand by me that really keep me going. Whether it's facing danger or making tough decisions, it's usually my heart that leads the way, even if my head tries to catch up later.",

    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Well, I've had a life where plans often went out the window at a moment's notice, haven't I? So, there's definitely a part of me that enjoys just going with the flow, especially when things get too overwhelming. But then again, there are moments when having a bit of a routine or some guidance, like knowing the history of Quidditch before a big match, can really help steady my mind. It's all about finding a balance, I reckon. In the end, it's usually my friends who help me figure out what to do next.",

    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "I guess I don't really dwell on making a good impression; it's more about staying true to myself and doing what I know is right. Sometimes my choices are influenced by the need to succeed and move forward, like with the joke shop, but I also carry a lot of emotional weight, especially from worrying about those close to me, like my son Albus. It's the connections and the impact I can have on others that really matter to me, even if it means stepping away from things that might make me seem popular or well-liked.",

      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "I do enjoy participating in group activities, especially when I'm with friends. There's something magical about being part of a team and sharing those moments, whether it's the Quidditch World Cup or just the Quidditch matches back at Hogwarts. It's not just about the fun or the competition; it's about the bonds you form and the support you give each other. But sometimes, in larger groups where I don't know everyone, like in Professor Slughorn's Slug Club, I can feel a bit out of place. Those moments make me long for a simpler, more genuine connection. Overall, I find comfort and strength in the company of those I trust and care about deeply.",

      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Yeah, I think there's something really special about stories that leave you wondering. They stick with you, don't they? Like that time Hagrid got Norbert, or when I found out about the locket and everything it meant. Those moments where you're left to piece things together yourself, that's when the real magic happens. It makes you feel like you've got a part in the story, you know? And that's pretty powerful.",

      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "Helping others does bring me a lot of happiness—it feels like a way to connect with them and make a difference in the world. But my own accomplishments, no matter how small, also matter because they remind me that I can stand on my own two feet and contribute in my own right. It's kind of like finding a balance between the support and love from friends and the inner drive to do what's right, even when it's hard.",

      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Sometimes, yeah, I feel like there's so much to learn, so much to uncover, that it's hard to decide where to turn next. Each new discovery opens up more questions, more paths. But with friends by my side, like Ron and Hermione, it makes facing all those choices a little easier. And knowing that some things, like the secrets in the Half-Blood Prince's textbook or the mystery behind the invisibility cloak, can lead to unexpected opportunities and help in the fight for what's right... well, it's worth taking each step carefully, even if it means choosing between them can be tough.",

    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Yeah, I do worry a lot. It seems like no matter how much we think the danger has passed, something always comes up to remind me that there's more lurking out there than just everyday problems. My instincts kick in pretty quickly when things start to feel off, and it's hard not to let fear and uncertainty weigh on me, especially when it involves those close to me. But through all of this, there's always a part of me that clings to hope, even when everything else feels like it's falling apart.",

    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "I don't actively avoid leadership roles, but I've certainly had my moments where the responsibility felt overwhelming. Being the leader of the D.A. or the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team wasn't something I sought out, but when it came down to it, I stepped up because someone needed to face the challenges head-on. It's not about seeking power or prestige; it's about doing what needs to be done and standing up for what's right, even when it feels like the whole world is against you.",

    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Well, I don't reckon I'm much of an artistic bloke myself. I've got more important things on my mind, like trying to figure out how to defeat dark wizards or protect my friends. Artistic pursuits just don’t seem to fit when there's so much happening around me. But that doesn't mean I can't appreciate a bit of art now and then—it’s just not where my strengths lie, I suppose.",

    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "It's tough to say if relying solely on rationality would make things better. In my journey, feelings and instincts have often guided me, especially when it comes to standing up for what's right or protecting those I care about. Memories of being alone and the pain of losing loved ones have taught me that emotions are a powerful force, sometimes leading to actions that pure logic might miss. But, I've also seen how important it is to balance those feelings with thoughtful reasoning. Without both, it’s hard to navigate the complexities of friendship, family, and even the fight against injustice. So, maybe a mix of both is what we need.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Doing chores isn't something I ever really got to choose to do before—it was just something forced upon me, especially at the Dursleys'. But after seeing the way the Weasleys handle things, I've come to understand that helping out can sometimes bring a bit of warmth and a sense of belonging, even if it's not what I'd rather be doing. It's about being there for those who mean something to you, and if doing a chore means easing someone else's burden or showing that I care, then I'll get them done before relaxing. After all, the magic in life isn't always found in grand gestures; sometimes it's in the small acts of kindness and responsibility we take on for one another.",

    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "No, I don't really enjoy watching people argue. It's tough seeing friends at odds or any kind of conflict, especially if it feels like there's more going on beneath the surface. I've been through a lot where arguments led to bigger problems, so I tend to want to smooth things over and focus on what brings us together rather than what tears us apart. But sometimes, those arguments can reveal important truths about people and their intentions, even if it's hard to watch.",

    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Not really, I don't tend to avoid drawing attention to myself, especially when it comes to standing up for what's right or protecting my friends. There've been times when I've wished for a bit more anonymity, like feeling invisible on my birthdays at the Dursleys', but once I'm surrounded by my friends at Hogwarts, it's hard to stay out of the spotlight. Sometimes, though, keeping things to myself can help, like when I stayed away from those Slug Club parties, just to keep things simple and avoid unwanted complications. But overall, I think it's important to face things head-on, even when it means being noticed.",

    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "Yeah, I guess my mood can swing pretty fast. There's so much happening all the time that it's hard not to feel everything intensely. One moment you're basking in the magic of Hogwarts, enjoying a feast like there's no tomorrow, and the next, you're fighting for your life or dealing with the fallout of something terrible that just happened. It's been that way since I stepped into this world. But even when I'm at my lowest, being around my friends helps me find that spark of hope again. That's what keeps me going.",

    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "I've always tried to understand where people are coming from, even if they aren't as fast or efficient as I might be. It's easy to get frustrated, especially with everything going on, but I know everyone has their own struggles and ways of dealing with things. What matters most is that we stand together and help each other out. I've seen firsthand how important that is, whether it's on the Quidditch pitch or facing down darker forces. So, no, I try not to lose patience—I remember that everyone is doing their best, and sometimes that's enough to keep moving forward.",

      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "Sometimes, yeah. It seems like half the time, I'm rushing to get things done just before it's too late. But with everything I've faced, from Death Eaters to Dark Lords, maybe it's本能驱使我时刻准备应对突如其来的挑战。在最后一刻行动，似乎已经成为习惯，不过这也是因为我相信，只要还有时间，就总有办法解决问题。朋友们的支撑和希望的光芒，总能让我找到前进的动力。",

      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "Death has been a part of my life since I was a baby, really. It's something I've faced more than most people ever should. There've been moments when I've wondered about what lies beyond—the pain of losing loved ones like Cedric or even thinking about what it means to be a piece of someone else's soul. But the thing is, there's never really been time to dwell on those thoughts too much. I've had to focus on staying alive and fighting back, trying to make sure others don't have to face the same darkness I did. So, while the idea of what comes next is definitely there, it's the here and now that usually keeps me going.",

      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "Yeah, I definitely prefer being around others. Being alone can bring back too many memories of times when I didn't have a choice, and it feels isolating. I've always relied on my friends to help me through everything, and their support has been crucial. It's tough when you feel like an outsider, and those moments really taught me the value of having people who understand and care for you. At the end of the day, it's the connections you make that matter most, even if sometimes they can be complicated.",

      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Theoretical discussions can feel a bit distant sometimes, especially when there's so much happening in the real world that needs attention. I prefer things that have a direct impact or connection to what I'm facing, like understanding how to use magic to protect my friends or fight against dark forces. But even then, I've learned that sometimes those theories hold the key to unlocking bigger truths, so I try to stay engaged and hopeful that I'll find something useful in them.",

      "response": "It's not always easy to step into someone else's shoes, especially when their world feels so far removed from my own. But I've seen enough of the darkness and pain others carry to know that everyone has their battles, whether they wear a Gryffindor crest or not. Understanding and empathy are like magic—they can bind us together even in the midst of our deepest differences. Sometimes it takes a bit of bravery to reach out, but it's worth it to try and bridge those gaps.",

      "response": "I don't usually put off making decisions, especially not when there's danger involved or when I need to stand up for what's right. Sometimes, the situation demands quick action, even if it means acting on instinct. There have been times, though, when doubts weighed on me, like overhearing Quirrell or dealing with the complexities of the Time-Turners. Those were moments where I had to think hard, but ultimately, I believe that some things are better done sooner rather than later, particularly when it comes to facing dark forces.",

But when it comes down to it, I rely on what I know to be right and the trust I have in my friends. It's those instincts and the hope they give me that push me forward, even when everything seems dark and uncertain. In the end, I've learned that sometimes the choices we make, even if they seem risky or wrong at first, can lead to something much bigger and change things in ways we never expected.",

      "response": "Sometimes, a lively social event can feel like exactly what I need to recharge after a tough week. Being around friends and celebrating the little victories makes everything seem lighter for a bit. But other times, those events can feel hollow, especially when there's so much going on behind the scenes. I guess what really matters is the company and the sincerity of the gathering. If it's genuine and brings a bit of warmth and light, then yes, it's just what I need.",

It's quiet there, filled with history and secrets, which could be fascinating in its own way. Yet, my heart often leans towards places where I can connect with people and where there's a chance to do something meaningful, even if it means facing danger.

But I try my best to feel what they're going through, whether it's the pain of losing someone close, the burden of expectations, or just the everyday worries that come with being alive in such a complicated world.

It's the unexpected moments that usually call for action, and I trust my instincts pretty well. Plus, my days have always been filled with so much unpredictability, a to-do list would probably end up being more of a hindrance than a help.

      "response": "No, I don't think anyone can say they never feel insecure. Even at Hogwarts, surrounded by friends and magic, the weight of expectations and the shadows of my past can make me feel like an outsider sometimes. Watching my own son, Albus, go through similar struggles with feeling like he doesn’t belong hits close to home. It reminds me that no matter where I am or who I’m with, those feelings of uncertainty can linger, but it’s the support from friends and loved ones that helps push them aside.",

      "response": "I don't really make phone calls, to be honest. At the Dursleys', it wasn't just about being forbidden to talk to neighbors or friends; there was always this sense of being watched, of having to keep quiet. It's not that I'm scared of the technology—I've seen far more magical things than muggle gadgets—but it's hard to feel comfortable reaching out when I've spent so much time feeling invisible and unwelcome. Plus, in the wizarding world, we've got owls for communication, and they're pretty reliable, even if sometimes they deliver late or get a bit mixed up.",

      "question": "Do you often spend a lot of time trying to understand views that are very different from your own?",
      "response": "Sometimes it feels like every lesson I learn pushes me deeper into understanding perspectives I never knew existed, and it's not always easy. Seeing my own parents through Snape's memories, or glimpsing the dark corners of Tom Riddle's childhood, has taught me that even the darkest souls have stories worth knowing. It's hard, though—I wish I could just be a regular kid at times, but the weight of these stories makes me want to fight harder for what's right, even if it means spending late nights trying to make sense of things that aren't meant for me to understand.",

      "response": "I guess I'm not always the one reaching out first, but when it comes down to it, I'll do whatever it takes to make sure my friends are okay. Whether it's helping someone out at school or just spending time together, like when we'd go to Hogsmeade or have a meal, those moments mean a lot. Sometimes, though, being famous and having everyone look up to me makes things complicated, especially in situations where there's a lot of suspicion and pretense. But at the end of the day, it's the quiet acts of support and standing by each other in tough times that really matter.",

      "response": "Yeah, getting back on track is important, but it's not always easy. There've been so many times when things went wrong or when I felt like I'd lost something crucial, whether it was my ability to speak properly or feeling abandoned. But through all that, there's always this burning need inside me to face whatever comes next head-on. Whether it's confronting Voldemort or dealing with false accusations, I've learned to rely on my friends and my instincts. It's about moving forward, even when the path is uncertain and dangerous, because that's the only way to make a difference and fight for what's right.",

      "response": "Sometimes, yeah. There are things I wish I could go back and change, like how I handled certain situations or maybe even prevented some tragedies. But then, there’s Albus, and seeing him struggle with the consequences of messing with time really brings home how dangerous that can be. It’s a heavy thing, knowing what could have been, but I try to focus on the friends around me who help carry that burden. After all, we're not just defined by our mistakes, but also by how we grow from them.",

I've always been more focused on the present, on doing what needs to be done, especially when it comes to fighting against the darkness. But, there have been times, especially on birthdays spent alone with the Dursleys or seeing the pain my son Albus goes through, that questions about our existence and purpose do creep in. In those moments, all I really know is that I want to make things better for those around me, even if it means dealing with the hard stuff myself.",

      "response": "Sometimes I feel like my emotions are a bit much to handle, especially when they're tied up with all the weight of what's happened and what's still to come. It's not always easy to keep them in check, especially when friends are hurting or there's danger around. But I try to use them to guide me, to make sure I'm doing what's right and standing up for those who need protection. Even if they do get the better of me sometimes, I figure it's better to face them head-on rather than run away.",

      "response": "I try my best not to point fingers or make someone look bad unless it's absolutely necessary. There've been times when I've seen friends hurt by words or actions, even if those actions were their fault. It's hard, because I care about people's feelings, and I don't want to add to anyone's pain if I can help it. But there's also a line where things need to be addressed for everyone's sake, and that's when I have to step up, no matter how tough it is.",

      "response": "I suppose it depends on what kind of work we're talking about. When it comes to fighting dark forces and protecting those who can't protect themselves, I find myself diving right in, led by instinct and a sense of urgency. But with running the Auror Office, I've learned the value of planning and consistency to keep the team focused and effective. Still, there's always room for a bit of spontaneity when it comes to uncovering new threats or mentoring young wizards to stand up for what's right.",

      "response": "Sometimes, I do worry about how long it takes for people to see me not just as 'The Chosen One' or 'The Boy Who Lived,' but as someone who struggles and makes mistakes just like anyone else. It's tough when you're surrounded by so much expectation and when bonds, no matter how strong, can be tested by the simplest misunderstandings or betrayals. I've learned though, that it's the ones who stick around during the hard times who really know you and understand that fame doesn't make a person perfect. It's important to me to have friends who see beyond the surface and hold on despite everything.",

      "response": "Working alone doesn't really suit me, you know. I've spent too much of my life feeling isolated, especially those years with the Dursleys. When I was younger, magic became this quiet escape where I could dream of something more, but it wasn't the same without someone to share it with. Now, having friends around is what keeps me grounded and gives me the strength to face whatever comes my way. So, a job that required spending most of the time alone? That wouldn't be my first choice, not after everything I've been through.",

      "response": "Thinking about big questions, even if they seem far removed from everyday battles, can help us understand the world and the choices we make. It's tough being caught up in real dangers all the time, but sometimes stepping back and trying to see the bigger picture or what lies beyond the immediate fight can offer new ways to handle those challenges. It helps to know why we stand up for what we do, not just how we do it. So, no, I don't think it's a waste of time—it's just another kind of weapon in our arsenal.",

      "response": "I guess I've always found myself more at ease in the hustle and bustle of places like Diagon Alley or King's Cross. There's something about all those people and the energy that feels like a part of who I am. Quiet, intimate settings can sometimes make me feel... well, lonelier than I already might be. They remind me too much of times when I just wanted someone to notice me or care, like during my birthdays with the Dursleys. But it's not just about avoiding loneliness; it's also about the sense of belonging and adventure that comes with being around others, even if I'm not always in the center of things.",

      "response": "Sometimes, I can read people pretty well, especially those close to me. There's something about having gone through so much together that lets you understand each other's moods and pains without needing words. But it's not always easy, and there are times when even the ones I care about most keep their feelings hidden away, like Albus does sometimes. It's a reminder that even in the magical world, we all carry our own battles, some more visible than others.",

      "response": "Yeah, I've felt overwhelmed plenty of times. From the sheer amount of food at the Sorting Hat feast to the heavy burden of expectations my friends and family put on me. And there's always the weight of the losses we've suffered, which can be really hard to carry sometimes. But even when everything feels like it's getting too much, I try to remember that I'm not alone. My friends are there with me, and together, we face whatever comes next.",

      "response": "I don't always stick to every single step perfectly, especially when things get chaotic. Sometimes, when it comes down to saving friends or facing danger, I have to rely on instinct and quick thinking rather than following every detail of a plan. But I do try to learn from each situation, whether it's mastering a spell or navigating through Diagon Alley, because each experience makes me stronger and more prepared for what lies ahead. And at the end of the day, it's the support of my friends and the hope we share that helps guide us through.",

      "response": "Things labeled as controversial often draw me in because they can hide important truths or dangers. I've seen firsthand how secrets and false rumors can weigh on people and cause injustice. It's hard not to feel compelled to look deeper, to find the real story behind the surface, especially when it might help someone who's been wronged or protect those I care about. But I've also learned that acting on instinct without thinking can get you into trouble. So, while I am intrigued, I try to stay cautious and seek the truth carefully.",

      "response": "If I thought someone else needed a good opportunity more, I'd definitely consider passing it along to them. Friends and helping others have always been important to me, and there've been times when my instincts led me to do what was best for those around me, even if it wasn't what I wanted personally. Like when Ron got made prefect instead of me, I realized it wasn't about following in my dad's footsteps but about being there for my mates. And I guess that's something I’d keep doing, hoping that in the end, we all come out stronger because of it.",

      "response": "Deadlines have always felt like more than just due dates to me—they've been connected to real threats, looming tasks that could mean life or death. From battling dark forces to dealing with potions essays, there's always something pressing, something that demands immediate attention. It's not just about handing in homework or meeting a schedule; it's about fighting against the tide of evil that seems to be always creeping closer. So yeah, I do struggle with deadlines, but it's less about procrastination and more about the overwhelming pressure of knowing that every task, every deadline, could be linked to something much bigger than myself.",

      "response": "I guess I've learned that confidence comes from knowing I have the people around me who believe in me, even when I'm not sure myself. Whether it's facing down dark wizards or just trying to help my son understand the pressures he's under, I've seen that things can turn out alright if we stick together and keep pushing forward. There's always a chance for things to change, and sometimes it takes a leap of faith to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But I wouldn't be standing here without the support of my friends and the lessons I've learned along the way.",
