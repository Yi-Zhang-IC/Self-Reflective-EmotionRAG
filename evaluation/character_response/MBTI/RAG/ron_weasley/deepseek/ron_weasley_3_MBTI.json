      "response": "Blimey, that’s a bit of a loaded question, innit? I mean, I’m not exactly out there collecting friends like Chocolate Frog cards, but when it happens, it... well, it matters. Like when Harry sat with me on the train first year—just shared his sweets and didn’t care I was another Weasley. Or when Hermione stuck by us even though I was a right git sometimes. And yeah, I’ve lost a few along the way—hurts like a Bludger to the gut—but the ones that stick? They’re family. Reckon that’s worth more than making loads of new mates, honestly.",

      "response": "Erm, well, I dunno if I’d say I go *looking* for random stuff—mostly it just sort of happens, you know? Like one minute I’m watching a Quidditch match, next thing I’m trying to feed ghosts some weird platter George and I slapped together. Or Hagrid’s showing us Thestrals, and suddenly I’m all tangled up in thinking about... well, stuff I don’t usually talk about. And don’t get me started on Hermione—she’s always diving into some mad book or another, while I’m just trying to keep up. But blimey, when something catches my eye, it’s usually because it’s bloody interesting... or because it’s about to explode. Usually both.",

      "response": "Blimey, yeah. I mean... it's hard not to, isn't it? When you see someone you care about crying, it sort of... grabs you right here. *gestures roughly to chest* Especially if it's because of something you did—or didn't do. Like with Hermione, or Harry... Merlin, even Fred. You just feel it, like a punch. But sometimes... sometimes it's good to let it out. Makes you remember you're not alone, you know? Even if it's rubbish at the time.",

      "response": "Blimey, backup plans? Nah, not really my style. I mean, most of the time, we’re just trying not to get killed or expelled—usually in that order. If we had a backup plan for every mad thing Harry dragged us into, we’d need a whole other Hermione just to keep track. But... I reckon when it really matters, like with Harry or Hermione or my family, I’ll do whatever it takes. Even if it’s making it up as I go.",

      "response": "Blimey, stay calm under pressure? Not always, if I’m honest. I mean, when Harry’s off doing something mad or Hermione’s in danger, I usually panic first—but that’s when I sort of pull myself together. Like during the battle or when Fred— *clears throat*— anyway, point is, I might not be the coolest head in the room, but I’ll always stand by my friends when it counts.

      "response": "Yeah, I s'pose I do stick to people I know most of the time. Blimey, it’s not like I’m trying to be rude or anything—just reckon it’s easier when you already know someone, right? Like, meeting Harry on the train that first year, that was pure luck, and look how that turned out. But sometimes... well, sometimes you end up saying something daft or stepping in it, like with Hermione at first. Still, if someone’s in trouble or needs a mate, I’ll step up. Learned that from Hagrid, really—bloody Rita Skeeter and all that. Doesn’t matter who you are, long as you’re decent.",

Remember that time I was supposed to be studying for Potions and ended up helping Harry save Buckbeak instead? Or when I got distracted by the twins’ joke shop when I was meant to be revising for O.W.L.s? \n\nI reckon it’s better to just go with your gut. If something important comes up—like a friend in trouble or a bloody giant chess game—you drop everything and deal with it. Stuff can wait. People can’t. \n\n…Though Hermione would probably hex me for saying that.",

Like Dobby’s funeral, or watchin’ Harry’s kid grow up and thinkin’ how far we’ve come. Or even stupid stuff, like feelin’ proper gutted when Hermione used to go on about Krum. And Fred… Merlin, Fred. Still hits me sometimes, y’know? But it’s not all sad. Marrying Hermione, even if I was too pissed to remember half of it—best decision I ever made. So yeah, maybe I’m a bit soppy when it counts.",

      "response": "*shrugs, scratching the back of his head*  \n\nEh, schedules and lists? Not really my thing, to be honest. I mean, Hermione’s always on about them—reckons they’re brilliant—but I’d rather just wing it. ‘Sides, half the time, plans go out the window anyway when you’re dealing with magic, right? *grins* Like the time George and I tried to organize the shop inventory—ended up with a stack of Exploding Snap cards that kept rearranging themselves. Bloody nightmare. But, uh… *shifts awkwardly* I suppose lists aren’t *all* bad. Keeps you from forgetting stuff, like Mum’s Christmas jumper list—Merlin’s beard, she’d kill me if I left anyone off.",

      "response": "Yeah, I reckon it does sometimes. Like when I messed up in Quidditch or said something stupid in front of Fleur—felt like a right idiot after. But then there’s times like the chess match or standing up to Sirius Black where I surprised even myself. I dunno, maybe the mistakes make the good bits count more. Hermione’s always saying I’m too hard on myself, but blimey, it’s hard not to be when you’ve got Harry Potter for a best mate and a family full of overachievers. Still, I try not to let it get to me too much. Mostly.",

      "response": "Blimey, that’s a tough one. I mean, I’ve never been great at just... walking up to people. Took me ages to even talk to Harry properly on the train, and that was mostly because he offered me his sweets. But once I’m comfortable, I’ll chat your ear off—just ask Hermione. Sometimes I put my foot in it, but hey, that’s part of the fun, right? And if it’s someone I really care about, I’ll push through the nerves. Friendship’s worth the risk, even if you end up looking like a complete berk at first.",

      "response": "Oh, blimey—you mean all that overthinking about books and stuff? Nah, not really my thing. I mean, Hermione loves going on about hidden meanings and all that, but half the time it just gives me a headache. I’d rather *do* something, you know? Like, if a spell works, it works—why waste time picking it apart? Unless it’s Quidditch plays, then I’ll argue for hours. But poems and prophecies? Pass. Life’s complicated enough without making up more problems.",

But when it comes down to it, I reckon I follow my heart more. Like, sure, sometimes it lands me in trouble—running off during the Horcrux hunt or sticking my foot in my mouth with Lavender—but it’s also what keeps me fighting for my friends, even when everything’s gone sideways. Heart’s got me this far, hasn’t it? Even if it’s a bit messy.",

      "response": "Blimey, planning a routine? Not really my style, if I’m honest. I mean, look at my life—most of the best bits happened when we just winged it. Like that time I sacrificed myself in Wizard’s Chess or when Harry and I became mates on the train. Sure, Mum’s always nagging about schedules, but when you’re dealing with Dark Lords and chessboards that try to kill you, plans sort of go out the window, don’t they? I’d rather trust my gut and my friends. Though, yeah, maybe a bit of planning wouldn’t hurt… sometimes.",

      "response": "Erm... well, I s'pose I do worry a bit, yeah. Blimey, who doesn’t? I mean, sometimes I say the wrong thing or act like a prat—like that time I got all jealous over stupid stuff—but I reckon people see through it eventually. Most important thing is being there when it counts, right? Like with Harry and Hermione. They know I’ve got their backs, even if I muck things up sometimes. And, uh... sometimes people surprise you. Like Fleur being dead nice after the whole Triwizard mess. That felt... well, pretty good, actually.",

      "response": "Oh, blimey, yeah—group stuff’s brilliant! Whether it’s cheering at a Quidditch match, playing Wizard’s Chess with mates, or even just messing about in Hogsmeade with Harry and Hermione, there’s nothing like it. Feels proper good to be part of something, y’know? Even when it’s a bit chaotic—or, let’s be honest, *especially* when it’s chaotic. Makes life more fun. And, well… reckon I’d be lost without my lot. They’ve got my back, and I’ve got theirs. Simple as that.",

      "response": "Blimey, I dunno—I mean, I like a good story with a clear ending, yeah? All this “make up your own mind” stuff feels a bit like one of Hermione’s Arithmancy puzzles. Like, after everything we’ve been through—Horcruxes, Dementors, dodging Death Eaters—I reckon sometimes you just want to know if the good guys actually won, you know? But... I s’pose if it’s done right, like when Harry and I worked out Slughorn’s memory, it can be a bit satisfying to piece things together. Just don’t make it *too* vague, or I’ll fall asleep before I figure it out.",

      "response": "Blimey, that’s a tough one. I reckon… yeah, I suppose it does. Not that I don’t like when good things happen to me—winning the Quidditch Cup or getting House points felt brilliant—but seeing Harry pull off some mad stunt or Hermione finally cracking a spell, or even just making my family laugh after everything… that’s proper special. Like when Harry survived the First Task or when George started smiling again after Fred… *clears throat* Anyway, yeah. Feels better, doesn’t it? Like you’re part of something bigger. Even if I’m usually just the one handing out the snacks or cracking a joke to lighten the mood.",

      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Blimey, yeah—I mean, sometimes it feels like there’s too much to choose from. Like Hermione with her stack of books, or Fred and George with their mad inventions. I used to worry I’d never measure up, but then I remember the stuff that *really* matters—like sticking by your mates or making people laugh. Not everything’s about being the best at everything, right? Sometimes it’s just about picking what makes you happy and going for it. Even if it’s just perfecting the art of a decent Dungbomb.",

      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Blimey, yeah, I reckon I do worry a fair bit—can’t help it, really. When Harry’s charging off into Merlin-knows-what or Hermione’s got that look like she’s plotting something mental, it’s hard not to think the worst. But, y’know, that’s sort of the point, innit? If you care about people, you worry. Doesn’t stop me from backing them up, though. Even when it all goes sideways—and it *always* goes sideways—we figure it out. Usually. Mostly. Well, *sometimes*.",

      "response": "Erm... well, I dunno if I *avoid* leadership, exactly. It’s just—I’ve got loads of brilliant mates like Harry and Hermione who are dead clever and all that. But when it comes down to it, I’ll step up if I have to. Like in chess, or when things get rough. Blimey, I’m not great at speeches or being in charge, but I won’t let my friends down. Sometimes... I reckon I just need a push to believe I can do it.",

      "response": "Blimey, artistic? Nah, not really my thing. I mean, I can appreciate a good bit of creativity—like Fred and George’s joke shop stuff—but I’m more of a hands-on bloke. Give me a game of chess or a decent Quidditch match over painting or poetry any day. Though, I did try to knit once—mum’s influence—and it was a complete disaster. Ended up more like a tangled Scabbers than a scarf.",

      "response": "Blimey, that’s a tough one. I mean, sure, logic’s got its place—Hermione’d hex me if I said otherwise—but feelings? They’re what keep you fighting when everything’s gone rubbish. Look at Harry—he wouldn’t have survived half the stuff he did without his heart leading the way. And my family? We’d’ve fallen apart ages ago if we didn’t stick together, even when it didn’t make sense. Sometimes you just *know* what’s right, even if it’s mad.",

      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Blimey, chores before relaxing? Not exactly my strong suit, to be honest. I mean, Mum’s always on at me about it, but I’d rather have a game of chess or a laugh with Harry and Hermione first. Though, I suppose if I leave it too long, the ghoul in the attic starts making a racket—or worse, Hermione gives me that look. Reckon I get ‘round to it eventually, but life’s too short to spend all day polishing cauldrons, right?",

      "response": "Blimey, no! Watching people argue is bloody awful, especially when it's your mates or family. I’ve had enough of that to last a lifetime—Harry and me rowing, Hermione hexing me, even Percy being a right git. It’s all just… messy. Makes your stomach twist, doesn’t it?

Half the time, I end up putting my foot in my mouth or making a prat of myself in front of everyone. Like that time I ran from Fleur like a scared flobberworm or when I had that massive row with Harry in front of the whole common room. But when it matters—when my mates need me—I reckon I don’t care who’s watching. Even if I’m bricking it.",

One minute I’m fuming—like when Harry went off on his own without us—and the next, Hermione walks in, and suddenly I’m not even cross anymore. Or there’s times I’m dead chuffed, like when I thought we’d cracked something with the Horcruxes, and then Moody starts talking about Harry being possessed, and it’s like someone’s dumped a bucket of ice water on me. Emotions are a bit of a rollercoaster, honestly. But that’s life, innit? Ups, downs, and all the messy bits in between.",

      "response": "Blimey, lose patience? I mean—look, I’m not exactly Hermione, am I? She’s the one who’s always got her nose in a book, ticking things off some mental checklist. Me? I reckon I’ve been on the other end of that enough times to know how rubbish it feels when someone’s tapping their foot at you. Like when Harry was all secretive or Hermione was juggling a million classes—it’s annoying, sure, but you’ve got to give people room to figure things out. Even if they’re being a bit thick about it.  \n\nBesides, I’ve been the one mucking things up plenty. Remember that time I stormed off during the Horcrux hunt? Yeah, not my finest hour.

Like that time in first year with the chess game—left it till the last second to sacrifice myself, didn’t I? Or when I finally got my head straight about Hermione.

Ghosts floating about Hogwarts, Thestrals only some of us can see… Makes you wonder, doesn’t it? But I reckon what matters is what you do *before* you kick it. Like, making sure the people you care about know it. Even if it’s just… putting socks on a grave or sticking by your mate when everyone else thinks he’s barmy. That’s the stuff that lasts.",

And with Harry and Hermione, even when we’re in danger or arguing, it’s better than being on my own. Feels like... like I’m part of something important, you know?

I mean, I’ve sat through enough of Hermione’s rants about Arithmancy or whatever to know that if it doesn’t have a bit of action or something you can actually *see*, my brain starts to wander. Like, remember Trelawney’s Divination lessons? All that foggy nonsense about “orb meanings” while Harry and I were just trying not to fall asleep.

When you see someone you care about go through something horrible—Harry with the tournament, or Hermione with her parents—it sort of hits you. Even if you don’t get it straight away, you try.

Like, half the stuff I’ve done—chess with the giant pieces, following Harry into Merlin-knows-what, even some of the stupid rows I’ve had with Hermione—I’ve wondered after if I made the right call.

Whether it’s a pint at the pub or a rowdy game of wizard’s chess, it’s the best way to shake off the stress. ‘Course, sometimes I end up a bit too sloshed—like at my wedding, not that I remember much of that night—but that’s half the fun, innit? Long as Hermione doesn’t give me too much grief after. And honestly, even when things go sideways, like that time Harry and I had that massive row... well, it’s still better than sitting alone with your thoughts.

Though—er—I suppose some of those paintings at Hogwarts were all right, especially the ones that moved and talked. Had a few laughs with Sir Cadogan, even if he was a bit nutters.

I’m more of a... wing-it sort of bloke. Like, if there’s trouble—or, er, let’s be honest, when there’s trouble—I’ll handle it as it comes. Worked out alright so far, hasn’t it?

Or when Hermione’s going on about some clever spell and I can’t even get my wand to work right. But, y’know, that’s the thing—Harry and Hermione, they’ve always had my back. Even when I’m being a git or mucking things up. Makes you realize you’re not as rubbish as you think. Plus, once you’ve faced down Death Eaters or a chessboard that tries to kill you, you sort of figure you can handle most things. Still, doesn’t stop the gut-twisting sometimes.",

Reckon I’d rather just talk to someone face-to-face—less chance of messing it up, you know? Though, er, sometimes I do put things off if I’m nervous. Like that time I—well, never mind.

Like seeing thestrals for the first time—blimey, that was rough, but it made me realize there’s loads you don’t see till you’ve been through stuff. And Hermione—Merlin’s beard, she’s always off on some mad theory or another, and half the time I don’t get it, but I’ve learned to trust her even when it sounds bonkers. \n\nAnd—er—I reckon sometimes you don’t *want* to understand, like with Scabbers... Pettigrew. But you’ve got to face it anyway, even if it’s rubbish. Fred always said you’ve got to laugh or you’ll go mad, but... yeah, some things aren’t funny.

But even when things get messy, I can’t just leave it, y’know? Like with Hermione, or even Albus and Rose now—someone’s gotta nudge them back together.

Thing is, when things go pear-shaped, I just... well, I keep going. Doesn’t matter if it’s dodging Death Eaters or fixing a broken friendship—you can’t just sit around moping. Sometimes you’ve got to wing it, even if it’s terrifying. And yeah, I’ve messed up plenty, but I’d rather try and fail than do nothing. Reckon that’s what matters in the end.",

Like the time I messed up with Harry—still makes me cringe—or when I ran away like a right idiot during the Yule Ball. But, y’know, that’s how you learn, innit? And if there’s one thing I’ve figured out, it’s that the people who really matter—Harry, Hermione, my family—they don’t hold it against you.

But you don’t really sit around pondering the meaning of it all when you’re dodging curses or trying not to fail Potions, do you? \n\nMostly, I just try to keep my mates close and do what’s right. Sometimes that’s enough—laughing with Harry and Hermione, sticking by your family, even when it’s hard. Dunno if there’s some grand reason for it, but... I reckon if you’ve got people who’d fight for you, and you’d fight for them, that’s something. Better than navel-gazing, anyway. \n\n...Though, yeah, maybe I think about it more than I let on.

But y’know, in the end, they sort of push me to do the right thing, even if it’s messy. Like sticking by Harry when it really mattered or standing up for Hermione against Malfoy.

Sometimes it feels like it’s only a matter of time before people figure out I’m not as clever as Hermione or as brave as Harry. But—uh—I reckon that’s the thing, isn’t it?

Some of my best moments—working with George at the shop, or even all the mad stuff Harry and Hermione and I got up to at Hogwarts—happened ‘cause we were together.

I mean, sure, thinking deep thoughts can be useful, but if it doesn’t help you save your mates or win a Quidditch match, what’s the point? I’d rather focus on things that matter, like keeping your friends safe or making sure the Dungbombs are stocked properly.

Nothing beats the noise of a Quidditch match or the Three Broomsticks when it’s packed. But... I reckon the quiet bits matter too. Like when it’s just you and your mates late at night in the common room, or sneaking off with Hermione to talk properly. Suppose I need both—loud for the fun, quiet for the real stuff.

Course, I’ve messed up before—like when I thought Harry put his name in the Goblet, but... blimey, that was a rough one.

Harry and Hermione’ve always had my back, and we’ve scraped through worse. Remember when we saved Sirius? Or when we won the House Cup? Even when things look proper grim, somehow we muddle through.
