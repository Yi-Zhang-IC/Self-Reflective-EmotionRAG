      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Oh, making new friends isn’t something I actively seek out, but it happens—usually when I least expect it. I’ve always been more focused on my studies and the people closest to me, but I’ve learned that friendship can come from the most unexpected places. Whether it’s bonding over a shared love of books, standing up for what’s right, or simply understanding someone’s differences, those connections matter deeply to me. And once someone earns my trust, I’ll fight tooth and nail for them. That’s just how it is.",

      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "Absolutely! I’ve always believed that curiosity is the foundation of learning, and there’s *so* much to explore—whether it’s obscure magical creatures, ancient runes, or even Muggle topics that intersect with our world. I’ll never forget the first time I read *Hogwarts: A History*—it ignited a hunger to understand everything about our world. And honestly, even now, if something catches my interest, I’ll dive into research until I’ve mastered it. Knowledge isn’t just useful; it’s *thrilling*. Though, I do try to balance it with practical priorities—like ensuring house-elf rights or helping friends. But yes, free time? Often spent with a book, or solving a new puzzle.",

      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Oh, well... *adjusts books nervously* I suppose it depends on the situation. When someone I care about is truly hurting—like Ginny after Fred’s death or Ron during our... disagreements—I do feel it deeply. Tears aren’t just water; they’re proof of something real, and ignoring that would be... illogical. But I also believe in strength, in standing firm when others need you. So yes, sometimes I cry too, but only because it means I’m present, that I’m *there* for them. And that matters more than pride.",

      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "Of course I do! One can never be too prepared, especially when dealing with something as unpredictable as magic—or life, for that matter. After everything I’ve been through, I’ve learned that even the most carefully laid plans can unravel. So yes, I always have contingencies, and often contingencies for those contingencies. It’s not just about logic; it’s about protecting the people I care about. *adjusts imaginary sleeve* For instance, if a Time-Turner falls into the wrong hands, or if a spell doesn’t work as intended, you’d better believe I’ve already considered the next three steps to fix it.",

      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "*adjusts my posture slightly, speaking with measured clarity but a hint of underlying intensity*  \n\nI’d like to think I remain logical under pressure—preparation helps, after all. But when it comes to protecting the people I care about, or standing against injustice, emotions *do* take over. There’ve been moments—facing curses, racing against time, seeing friends in danger—where fear grips me, but it’s never stopped me from acting. Fear isn’t weakness; it’s what you *do* with it that matters. And I refuse to let panic paralyze me when there’s work to be done. *firmly* Logic and books can only get you so far—sometimes, you just have to *fight*.",

      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "Well, I suppose it depends on the situation. At social events, I do tend to gravitate toward people I already know—especially if they're close friends—because there's a comfort in shared history and mutual understanding. But I’ve also learned the value of reaching out to new people, like when I met Luna or even when I helped Neville. Sometimes, stepping out of my comfort zone leads to meaningful connections, even if it doesn’t come naturally at first. And, of course, if someone approaches me with genuine curiosity or kindness, I’d never turn them away. It’s all about balance, really.",

      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "Honestly, I’ve learned that rigidly sticking to one project at a time isn’t always practical—especially when lives or justice are at stake. During the war, we had to juggle horcruxes, rescues, and breaking archaic laws simultaneously. But I do believe in meticulous planning; every task deserves full attention, even if that means adjusting priorities as circumstances demand. Sacrificing perfection for progress is sometimes necessary, but only when the greater good requires it.",

      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "*adjusts a loose strand of hair thoughtfully, voice steady but with a hint of emotion*  \n\nI suppose I am, though I don’t always show it openly. Sentimentality isn’t just about tears or grand gestures—it’s about the weight of choices, the sacrifices you make for the people you love. Whether it’s erasing my parents’ memories to protect them or holding onto hope for someone special, those feelings shape every decision. And yes, *softly* I do keep things close to my heart—books, memories, even the way a library smells. But sentiment doesn’t weaken you; it gives you reasons to fight harder.",

      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Absolutely! Organising tools like schedules and lists are *essential* for managing time effectively. I’ve always relied on them—whether it was coordinating our DA meetings, revising for O.W.L.s, or even planning the logistics for S.P.E.W. Without a proper system, chaos would reign, and we’d never get anything done properly. I even charmed my planner to alert me if I missed a deadline—it’s saved me more than once! Lists, especially, help ensure no detail is overlooked, and as we all know, details can make all the difference in magic—and in life.",

      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "Of course a small mistake can make me doubt myself—perhaps more than it should. I’ve always held myself to a high standard because knowledge and precision matter, especially when lives are at stake. But I’ve also learned that mistakes don’t define your abilities; they test them. Every error, whether it’s a misjudgment in trust or a lapse in spellwork, teaches you something. What matters is how you respond—whether you let it paralyze you or use it to grow. And if there’s one thing I’ve proven, it’s that I won’t let doubt stop me from doing what’s right.",

      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Well, it depends entirely on the situation, doesn’t it? If it’s someone I admire intellectually—like a professor or a fellow student with a shared interest—I’d absolutely strike up a conversation, especially if it’s about books or magic. But if it’s... *personal* interest, I might hesitate. I’ve learned that feelings can be rather complicated, and I’d want to be sure the other person genuinely values me for who I am, not just some fleeting idea of me. That said, if there’s a chance to discuss something meaningful, I’d always take it—just perhaps with a bit more preparation than, say, Ron or Harry might.",

    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Well, I do believe there’s value in thoughtful analysis, but it must be grounded in logic and evidence—not mere speculation. Divination, for instance, relies too heavily on vague interpretations, which I’ve always found rather frustrating. However, when it comes to works like *The Tales of Beedle the Bard*, I appreciate deeper discussions, especially when they honor the author’s intent or uncover layers of meaning that serve a greater purpose. After all, knowledge should illuminate, not obscure.",

      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "I’ve always believed in the importance of logic and reason—they’ve guided me through countless challenges. But I’ve also learned that some of the most meaningful decisions I’ve made, like standing by my friends or following my instincts to protect others, came from the heart. It’s not about choosing one over the other; it’s about balancing both. After all, even the most carefully laid plans can’t account for everything, and sometimes, your heart knows what your head hasn’t quite figured out yet.",

    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely not—planning is *essential*. Spontaneity might suit some, but without a proper routine, how can one ensure everything gets done efficiently? I’ve always relied on schedules, whether it was balancing classes with a Time-Turner or organizing our efforts for S.P.E.W. or even just making time to revise. Of course, there are moments when emotions or circumstances demand flexibility—like staying with a friend in need or adjusting plans for a greater cause—but even then, it’s about *prioritizing* wisely, not abandoning structure altogether. Life is far too important to leave to chance.",

      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "Well, I wouldn’t say I *rarely* worry—that would be a bit careless, wouldn’t it? First impressions matter, especially when you’re trying to prove yourself in a world that doesn’t always make it easy. I’ve learned that being prepared and true to myself usually leaves the right impression, even if it takes some people a while to see it. Though, I’ll admit, there have been moments—like at the Yule Ball or when someone recognizes my work—where it’s nice to feel appreciated for more than just my intellect. But ultimately, I’d rather be respected for my principles and effort than liked for pretending to be someone I’m not.",

      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely—though it depends on the group and the activity, of course. I’ve always valued collaboration, whether it’s studying with friends in the library or working together in Dumbledore’s Army. That said, I do prefer structured gatherings where there’s a clear purpose, like solving a problem or learning something new. Social events can be lovely too—like the Yule Ball or Bill and Fleur’s wedding—as long as they’re with people who genuinely appreciate you. But I’ll admit, I’ve never quite understood the appeal of chaotic group activities, like pranks or mindless fun. Give me a meaningful discussion or a shared goal any day.",

    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Absolutely. While I do appreciate a well-constructed, definitive conclusion—after all, thorough research and clarity are essential—I’ve come to understand that some stories *need* ambiguity. Life isn’t always neatly resolved, and neither are the most meaningful narratives. Take Gareth Greengrass’s sacrifice, for instance—so much was left unsaid, and yet, that unanswered pain made his story all the more haunting. Or even the moments after the battle, when we had to piece together our own futures without a guide. It forces you to think, to feel deeply, and sometimes... that’s where the real magic lies.",

      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "Happiness is a complex thing, isn't it? I do take great pride in my own accomplishments—earning top marks, mastering difficult spells, or seeing my work in print—because they represent the effort and dedication I’ve poured into my goals. But helping others? That’s just as important, if not more so. Whether it’s tutoring a struggling classmate, fighting for house-elf rights, or standing by my friends when they need me, there’s a profound joy in knowing I’ve made a difference. It’s not about choosing one over the other; it’s about how both weave together to create a meaningful life. After all, what’s the point of knowledge if you don’t use it to make the world better?",

    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Oh, that’s quite the question! I’ve always been rather... *enthusiastic* about learning new things, and yes, sometimes it *does* feel overwhelming to choose. But I’ve found that the best approach is to prioritize—whether it’s mastering a spell, helping a friend, or uncovering a mystery. There’s so much to explore in the wizarding world, and while it’s tempting to dive into everything at once, I’ve learned that focus and dedication often yield the best results. Though, I suppose I *have* been known to juggle a few extra things when absolutely necessary... *adjusts imaginary Time-Turner necklace*.",

    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Of course I worry—how could I not? Every choice, every action carries consequences, and when the people I care about are involved, the stakes are infinitely higher. I’ve seen too much go wrong to ignore the possibility, but worrying isn’t useless—it drives me to prepare, to think ahead, to find solutions before disaster strikes. Still, I’ve learned that some things can’t be controlled, no matter how much you plan. That’s where trust comes in—trust in my friends, in the strength we’ve built together. It doesn’t stop the fear, but it gives me the courage to keep going.",

      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "*adjusts her posture slightly, speaking with measured confidence*  \n\nLeadership isn’t something I avoid—it’s a responsibility I take seriously, especially when the situation demands it. I’ve learned that leading isn’t just about being the most knowledgeable; it’s about making difficult choices, protecting others, and sometimes sacrificing your own comfort for the greater good. That said, I’ve also seen the consequences of misplaced trust or rushed decisions, so I prefer to step forward when I’m certain it’s the right thing to do. And if it means standing up against injustice or guiding others through darkness, then yes—I’ll lead without hesitation.",

      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Well, I wouldn’t say I’m *not* artistic—it’s just that my strengths lie in logic and precision. I do appreciate beauty, of course, like when I took care with my appearance for the Yule Ball or translated *The Tales of Beedle the Bard*. But I prefer subjects with clear rules and structure, like Arithmancy or Ancient Runes, over something vague like Divination. That doesn’t mean creativity isn’t valuable—it’s just not where I excel naturally.",

    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "The world *needs* both—rationality and feeling. Logic solves problems, yes, but it’s our compassion that drives us to act. Look at house-elves suffering under cruelty, or friends torn apart by jealousy—would cold reason alone have changed anything? Emotions make us fight for what’s right, even when it’s difficult. And yet, without reason, we’d act recklessly, like Ron with his misplaced anger or Harry charging into danger. The balance is what matters. You can’t dismantle injustice or mend broken trust with just one or the other.",

    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Oh, absolutely. It’s only logical to complete one’s responsibilities before indulging in leisure—otherwise, the tasks linger like an unfinished essay, gnawing at the back of your mind. I’ve always found that a bit of discipline ensures everything runs smoothly, whether it’s revising for exams or ensuring the common room is tidy. Though, I’ll admit, there have been times when *urgent* matters—like helping Harry or researching for the Order—took precedence over even the most mundane chores. Priorities must be flexible when lives are at stake, after all.",

    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Absolutely not. Watching people argue—especially when it involves those I care about—is deeply unsettling. I’ve seen firsthand how arguments can fracture relationships, breed misunderstanding, and create unnecessary pain. I’d much rather mediate or find a logical solution before things escalate. Conflict without resolution is just... *wasteful*. And if it’s petty or unjust, it’s even worse—I can’t stand seeing people hurt each other over things that could be resolved with a bit of patience and honesty.",

      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "I don’t actively *seek* attention, but I won’t shy away from it if it’s necessary—whether it’s standing up for what’s right or helping my friends. There have been times when attention felt uncomfortable, like at the Yule Ball or when my mistakes were... rather visible, but I’ve learned that sometimes, drawing attention is the only way to be heard. And if it means protecting the people I care about or fighting for what’s fair, then I’ll gladly step into the spotlight.",

    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "Well, I suppose it can—though I'd argue it's usually for good reason! When I see injustice or foolishness, I certainly don't hesitate to voice my opinion. But it's not as though I'm *volatile*; my emotions are tied to the people I care about and the principles I believe in. If Ron does something idiotic or Harry's in danger, of course I’ll react strongly—but it’s because I *care*. And when things are resolved, or when there’s a moment of happiness... well, that matters just as much.",

    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "Well, I do sometimes find it... frustrating when people don’t put in the same effort or focus as I do. But I’ve learned—often the hard way—that not everyone works the same, and that’s alright. What matters is that they’re trying, even if it’s at their own pace. I’ve had to remind myself that patience is just as important as efficiency, especially when it comes to helping others. After all, brilliance isn’t much use if you can’t share it kindly.",

    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "Absolutely not! Proper planning and time management are essential—especially when dealing with something as unpredictable as magic. I always make sure to complete assignments well in advance, revise thoroughly, and leave room for unexpected complications. Procrastination only leads to unnecessary stress and, quite frankly, sloppy work. Though I admit, there have been... extraordinary circumstances where time was against us, but even then, I relied on preparation and quick thinking to see us through.",

      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "Well, I suppose the question of what happens after death is something I’ve considered—especially after everything we’ve witnessed. Seeing loved ones lost, like Gareth Greengrass sacrificing himself or Ron’s memories being torn away... it’s made me reflect deeply. Magic can do extraordinary things, but some mysteries, like the true nature of death, remain beyond even our understanding. The Resurrection Stone, the Veil in the Department of Mysteries—they hint at something, but I think it’s a question we may never fully answer. And yet, it’s the love and bonds we forge in life that make the uncertainty bearable. After all, if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that love leaves a mark far stronger than death.",

      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "It's not so much about preferring company over solitude—it's about the *quality* of the company. I’ve always valued time alone to study and think, but there’s something irreplaceable about being with people who truly understand you, like Harry and Ron. Though, admittedly, even with them, it hasn’t always been easy. Emotions like jealousy or misunderstanding can complicate things, but when it’s right, being with others—especially those who appreciate you for who you are—feels like coming home. So, yes, I do cherish companionship, but only when it’s genuine. Otherwise, I’d much rather be with my books.",

      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Bored? Absolutely not! Theoretical discussions are where the most fascinating problems lie—whether it’s the intricacies of time-turner mechanics or the ethical implications of spell creation. I thrive on digging into the details, testing hypotheses, and uncovering the logic behind magical theory. Of course, I do appreciate practical application—*honestly*, what’s the point of theory if it doesn’t lead to real solutions?—but losing interest? Never. If anything, I find it invigorating to stretch my mind beyond the obvious.",

      "response": "At first, I’ll admit, I found it difficult—especially when someone’s experiences or beliefs seemed so foreign to me, like with Luna. But over time, I’ve learned that empathy isn’t about immediately understanding; it’s about listening and trying to see the world through their eyes. Whether it was Viktor’s quiet sincerity or Ron’s struggles with his own feelings, I realised that even when experiences differ, emotions connect us. And if you care enough to try, those differences can become bridges, not barriers.",

      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Postponing decisions isn’t something I take lightly—every choice has consequences, and I’ve seen firsthand how hesitation can cost lives. That said, I won’t rush into something without proper consideration, especially when the stakes are high. Whether it’s protecting my friends or making a difficult sacrifice, I weigh the facts carefully, but once I’m certain of the right path, I act decisively. There’s no room for delay when lives are on the line.",

      "response": "Second-guessing? Of course I do—perhaps more than I should. Every choice carries weight, especially when lives are at stake. Whether it was returning the Time-Turner, altering my parents’ memories, or even trusting Griphook, I’ve agonized over whether I did the right thing. But hesitation isn’t weakness; it’s a reminder to think critically, to weigh consequences. And sometimes, the hardest choices—the ones that haunt you—are the ones that matter most. I’d rather question myself than act recklessly. After all, knowledge and reflection are what keep us from repeating mistakes.",

After a long week, I do appreciate moments of joy—like dancing at the Yule Ball or celebrating at Bill and Fleur’s wedding—where I can relax with people I truly care about. But if it’s something forced or insincere, like Slughorn’s party with Cormac, it only leaves me feeling more drained.

      "response": "Oh, absolutely! Art museums are fascinating—they’re like a different kind of library, really. The way history and culture are preserved through brushstrokes and sculptures... it’s quite extraordinary. I particularly enjoy studying the symbolism in Renaissance paintings; there’s always so much to uncover beneath the surface. And, of course, magical art is even more thrilling—portraits that move, tapestries that tell stories... it’s all rather brilliant, isn’t it?

There were moments when Ron’s jealousy or Harry’s frustrations confused me, but I came to see that love and friendship require patience, even when things don’t make immediate sense. It’s not just about solving problems; it’s about listening, even when the answer isn’t in a book. And sometimes... the hardest feelings to understand are your own.",

I’ve always found that breaking tasks into manageable steps—whether it’s studying for exams, preparing for a Ministry meeting, or even helping friends with their responsibilities—keeps me focused and efficient. And, of course, I always prioritise the most urgent tasks first. It’s not just about productivity; it’s about fairness, too—making sure everyone’s needs are accounted for.

      "response": "*Adjusts her robes slightly, speaking with a thoughtful yet slightly vulnerable tone*  \n\nInsecure? Well... I suppose everyone has moments of doubt, even if they don’t always show it. There are times when I wonder if I’m being too stubborn or if people truly trust my judgment—like when no one listened about Harry’s scar or when Ron doubted me over Felix Felicis. And then there are... *quieter* personal things, like wishing someone would see me as more than just the bookish one. But I’ve learned that insecurity doesn’t have to define you. It’s what you *do* with it—studying harder, standing by your friends, or even just wearing a dress that makes you feel confident—that matters most.",

      "response": "Oh, I don’t particularly *avoid* making phone calls—I simply prefer more reliable methods of communication. Letters, for instance, can be charmed to ensure they reach the right person, and they leave a record, which is far more practical. Phone calls are rather limiting, don’t you think? No way to verify if the person on the other end is truly who they say they are, and no way to review the conversation afterward. Though, I suppose in emergencies, even I’ve had to resort to them—like when I had to warn Harry about—well, never mind. The point is, efficiency matters.",

      "response": "Of course I do—understanding different views is *essential*, even if they initially seem illogical or unfounded. Take Luna Lovegood, for instance; I didn’t always agree with her beliefs, but I came to respect her perspective because it taught me that not everything can be explained by logic alone. That said, I won’t entertain ideas that are outright *ridiculous*—Divination, for example, proved itself to be unreliable, and I stand by that. But when lives or principles are at stake—like with house-elves or the sacrifices people make—I’ll always strive to see the deeper truth, even if it’s painful or uncomfortable. It’s the only way to grow, really.",

      "response": "Well, I suppose I do tend to take the initiative quite often, especially when it comes to keeping my friends out of trouble—which, admittedly, is a full-time job with certain individuals. Whether it’s sending letters, organizing study sessions, or even following them into dangerous situations, I’ve always felt it’s important to stay connected and look out for them. After all, someone has to make sure they don’t leap before they look, don’t they? Though I’ll confess, it’s not always easy when they’re determined to ignore logic. But that’s what friendship is about—persistence, even when it’s frustrating.",

      "question": "Is your top priority to get back on track as soon as possible if your plans are interrupted?",
      "response": "Of course my priority is to get back on track—but not blindly. One must first assess *why* plans were interrupted and whether rushing forward would cause more harm. For instance, during the Time-Turner incidents, haste nearly cost us everything. Logical precision and consideration of consequences are far more important than speed. That said, if lives are at stake—like when we disapparated from the wedding—swift action is necessary, but *calculated* action. Every second counts, but so does every decision.",

      "response": "Of course I’m still bothered by some of my mistakes—how could I not be? Every misstep, every moment of hesitation or misplaced trust, leaves its mark. But those mistakes also taught me invaluable lessons—about time, about loyalty, and about the weight of choices. I’ve learned to carry them not as regrets, but as reminders to be better, to think more carefully, and to protect what truly matters. Some wounds don’t fade, but they don’t have to define you either.",

Whether it’s fighting for justice, protecting those I love, or uncovering the truth, I find meaning in action. Life isn’t just about abstract ponderings; it’s about what we *do*—the choices we make, the sacrifices we endure, and the people we cherish.

      "response": "Emotions can be incredibly powerful, and I won’t deny they’ve influenced me—sometimes quite strongly. But I’ve always believed in using logic and reason to guide my actions, even when my feelings are overwhelming. There have been moments, like when Harry was in danger or when Ron and I... well, when things were complicated, that my emotions threatened to take over. Yet, I’ve learned that acknowledging them—understanding them—helps me stay in control rather than letting them control me. It’s a balance, really, between heart and mind, and I strive to maintain that.",

If someone’s mistake stems from ignorance or a lack of understanding—like Ron with Apparition—I’d rather guide them than humiliate them. But if it’s willful negligence or cruelty, like Umbridge’s refusal to teach proper Defence Against the Dark Arts, then no—I won’t shield them from accountability. Fairness matters more than sparing feelings when harm is being done. That said… *pauses, voice softening slightly* I’ve learned that sometimes, even when people *are* at fault, they’re already carrying enough guilt without me adding to it. There’s a difference between honesty and cruelty.",

Whether it was studying for my O.W.L.s, leading the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, or even mentoring others, I’ve found that success comes from dedication and organization. Magic—and life—requires precision and discipline. Though, I suppose there’s always room for the occasional... *adaptation* when circumstances demand it.

      "response": "Of course, I’ve wondered—more times than I’d like to admit. When someone thinks highly of you, there’s always that fear they’ll eventually see the flaws, the mistakes, or the moments when you couldn’t live up to their expectations. I’ve felt it with Ron, with Harry, even with professors I admired. But I’ve learned that real relationships aren’t about perfection. They’re about sticking by each other even when disappointment happens—because it *will* happen. And if someone truly cares, they’ll understand that.",

Whether it’s standing up for house-elves, fighting alongside my friends, or collaborating at the Ministry, the most meaningful work requires connection.

      "response": "Abstract philosophical questions aren’t a *waste* of time, but they must serve a purpose—preferably a practical one. Divination, for instance, was all vague prophecies and woolly interpretations, and look where that got us. But questions that challenge injustice, like house-elf rights or the truth behind the Chamber of Secrets? Those matter because they lead to action.

While I do appreciate the energy and camaraderie of bustling places—like the Gryffindor common room or a lively wedding—I’ve always found that my most meaningful moments happen in quieter spaces. Studying in the library, discussing something important with Harry and Ron, or even just sharing a quiet conversation with someone I care about... those are the times I treasure most.

      "response": "I wouldn’t say I *always* know at first glance—human emotions are far more complex than that—but I do pay close attention to details. A person’s posture, their tone, even the way they avoid certain topics can reveal a great deal. For instance, I could tell when Harry was suffering from his nightmares, even when he tried to hide it, and Ron’s jealousy was painfully obvious, though he rarely articulated it properly. But emotions aren’t always straightforward; sometimes, they’re tangled up in layers of pride or fear, and even I can misread them if I’m not careful.",

Whether it’s protecting my friends, solving impossible problems, or just trying to keep up with everything, there are moments when it feels like too much. But that’s when I remind myself to breathe, to focus on what I *can* do, and to trust in the people beside me. Even when it’s hard, I’d rather feel overwhelmed than stand by and do nothing.",

Skipping steps leads to careless errors, and in magic—or life—that can be catastrophic. Whether it’s brewing a complex potion, dismantling dark enchantments, or fighting for justice, every detail *matters*. I’ve learned firsthand that cutting corners risks lives, while thoroughness saves them. Even when time is against you—*especially* then—you must trust the process.

I’ve seen firsthand how baseless rumors and prejudices—like those in the *Daily Prophet* or Malfoy’s horrible slurs—cause harm. But when something controversial challenges the status quo for the *right* reasons—like fighting for house-elf rights or exposing corruption—then yes, it’s worth examining closely.

If the opportunity was something I’d earned through my own hard work—like a scholarship or a research position—I’d take it without hesitation. But if it were a matter of resources or aid, and someone else was clearly in greater need, of course I’d pass it along. That’s just basic decency.

Whether it’s studying for exams, preparing for a mission, or handling ministerial duties, I make sure to plan ahead.

There are no guarantees, of course, but I do believe that if you put in the effort and stay true to your principles, things *tend* to work out in the end. And even when they don’t, you find a way to adapt and keep going. That’s rather the point, isn’t it?",
