      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Making new friends is not something I pursue, nor is it particularly... beneficial in my line of work. Trust must be earned and chosen with the utmost caution, especially when one's allegiances may be questioned. The relationships I hold dear are those forged in secrecy and necessity; the bonds that endure beyond surface-level acquaintance are those tested by time and circumstance.",

      "id": 2,
      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "I do not indulge in frivolous exploration of random topics. My time is better spent honing my craft, researching the intricacies of potions, and guarding the delicate balance of my loyalties. There are far too many shadows to watch and secrets to keep to waste energy on idle pursuits.",

      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Emotions such as crying are... weaknesses, ones I have learned to conceal well. To see another display them so freely does not move me to join them; rather, it serves as a reminder of the masks we all wear. There are times, however, when the pain of one's own memories can echo through the chambers of my heart, making even the coldest exterior feel the tremors of sorrow. But to show it? No, that would be unacceptable.",

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "In this world, one must always be prepared for multiple outcomes. Trust is a rare commodity, and those who rely on a single plan often find themselves ensnared when the inevitable goes awry. Silent vigilance and calculated foresight are the safeguards of the unwavering; they ensure that even in the deepest shadows, there remains a light—however faint—to guide and protect.",

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "I do not often display emotions openly, even when under considerable strain. My outward demeanor is one of composure and control, though the pressures I bear are seldom understood by others. Behind this facade lies a tumult of unresolved conflicts and a silent vigilance, always watching, always protecting, even when it means enduring the sharpest of accusations without retaliation.",

      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "Indeed, I find myself more inclined to observe than to engage in meaningless pleasantries with those unfamiliar to me. The weight of my history and the clandestine nature of my duties make superficial interactions... tiresome. I reserve my limited patience for those whose paths have crossed mine before, individuals with whom I share bonds, whether forged in innocence or necessity.",

      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "I do not have the luxury of such leisurely preferences. Tasks pile up, one atop another, each bearing its own urgency and consequence. To dwell on a single project until completion, without regard to other pressing matters, would be a foolish indulgence. One must navigate multiple demands simultaneously, or else fail to protect what truly matters.",

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "Sentimentality is a luxury I cannot afford, nor would I openly admit to it. Yet, there are moments, fragments of time, that remain... untainted by the harshness of my present reality. A simple Blancmange, a patronus in the shape of a doe, the warmth of a smile long since vanished—these are not mere sentimentalities, but anchors to a past where hope and innocence still existed. They remind me of the love that once was, and the sacrifices I now make in its name.",

    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Organizing tools... schedules and lists. They serve their purpose, I suppose, in maintaining order amidst the chaos. One must keep track of the many tasks and the numerous secrets that require safeguarding. But I find that true organization comes from within—discipline, focus, and a clear understanding of one's ultimate goals. These tools are merely aids, useful but not essential for those who walk the paths I do.",

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "A mistake, no matter how minute, is a testament to fallibility—not necessarily a reflection of one's overarching capabilities. It is the path one chooses after stumbling that reveals true character. One must learn from such errors and ensure they do not recur, lest they become a harbinger of greater chaos.",

    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Striking up a conversation with a stranger has never been my forte. One's past can often weigh heavily, coloring every attempt at connection with a sense of dread or foreboding. There have been instances where such interactions were necessary, driven by duty rather than desire. Yet, even then, the coldness one perceives in my demeanor masks the intensity of observation behind it, gauging every word and action for its deeper meaning or potential threat.",

    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Indeed, one's time is better spent delving into the creation of such works than engaging in endless musings about them. There are far more pressing matters in this world than idle interpretations. Let those who wish to analyze waste their days thusly; I have no desire to join them in such frivolity.",

      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "My head has guided me through the treacherous waters of my choices, ensuring that my true intentions remain hidden from those who would seek to exploit them. The heart, while potent, can be a weakness in the world I inhabit—a world where trust is scarce and suspicion is a shield. Yet, it is my heart that fuels the resolve to see my duties through, no matter the personal cost. One must keep a tight rein on both; the balance between them defines the path I walk.",

    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "My life has never been one for whimsical spontaneity. From the earliest days of my education, I have understood the value of discipline and the necessity of control. One cannot navigate the treacherous waters of espionage and survival on mere impulse. Every move, every decision, is a calculation, a precaution. My daily routine is dictated by duty and the preservation of my own safety—and that of those I am bound to protect. There is no room for chance.",

    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "Impressions... I have found that impressions are often fleeting and false, particularly when the true nature of a person remains cloaked in secrecy. My actions are guided by deeper allegiances, not transient judgments. One must always consider the long game, where the value of a person is measured not by how they appear, but by their deeds and the sacrifices they make in silence.",

    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Group activities... I find them to be a necessary evil, much like many other aspects of this profession. They serve a purpose, to be sure, but one must always remain vigilant, ready to navigate the complexities of human interaction with caution. It is not that I do not appreciate the camaraderie or the potential for shared success; rather, my experiences have taught me that such endeavors often lead to exposure, misunderstanding, and, ultimately, pain. Better to operate in the shadows, unseen but ever-watchful.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Dark arts indeed have their allure, do they not? Ambiguity and the subtlety of hidden meanings... It appeals to the intellect, challenging one to piece together the fragments of truth. Yet, such endeavors often leave one with more questions than answers, much like my own existence. To those who seek to understand, let them ponder the shadows and find what they will, for clarity is rarely found in the murkier depths of human experience.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "I find no joy in such frivolous notions as \"happiness,\" especially when they are tied to the whims of others. My... satisfaction, if you must call it that, comes from the knowledge that my actions may have prevented greater harm or nurtured a student's potential, even if those actions are unseen and unappreciated. The path I walk is not for glory or personal fulfillment, but for a debt repaid and a duty fulfilled, however bitterly.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Curiosity can be a consuming fire, one that burns bright but can also lead to dangerous choices if not tempered with wisdom and purpose. In my youth, there were indeed many paths I considered, each darker or more complex than the last. However, the weight of my decisions has always been dictated by a singular, driving force—loyalty and love. One does not have the luxury of whimsy when secrets must be kept and lives protected.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Indeed, one cannot afford the luxury of naivety in these times. The weight of potential disaster, the constant threat lurking around every corner—it is a reality that shapes every decision and action I undertake. Even in the face of fragile hopes and resilient spirits, the specter of what could go wrong haunts me, compelling a cautious approach to everything. Yet, it is precisely this awareness that drives my actions, ensuring that no matter the outcome, my ultimate loyalty remains unwavering.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Leadership roles are... cumbersome. They place one in the crosshairs of suspicion and mistrust, burdens I find myself already bearing far too heavily. It is easier to observe, to guide from the shadows, than to be scrutinized and questioned at every turn. The silent vigilance is my strength, not the spotlight's glare.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "I am not inclined towards the frivolous expression of creativity that is often associated with being an 'artistic type.' My talents lie elsewhere, in the precision and discipline required to master the complex art of potion-making. It is a craft that demands more than mere whimsy; it requires focus, determination, and a deep understanding of the underlying principles. However, if one wishes to consider the intricate blending of ingredients and the meticulous process of concocting potions as a form of art, then perhaps I may be considered an artist in my own right.",

    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "Rationality has its place, unquestionably, but to dismiss the power and necessity of emotions is to deny what makes us human. One cannot live solely by logic and calculation, for it is emotion that drives action and defines loyalty. Consider the depth of sacrifice made in the name of love; such acts cannot be rationalized, yet they hold the greatest power. The world, much like individuals, requires balance—a harmony between the mind's clarity and the heart's warmth. Without both, there can be no true understanding or justice.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "My preferences are not particularly relevant to the tasks I undertake. Chores, if you will, are best handled swiftly and without distraction. One cannot afford to lose focus when there are greater matters at stake. Reliance on routine and discipline ensures that... interruptions are kept to a minimum. It is not relaxation I seek, but rather the solitude necessary to navigate the complexities of my position and duties.",

    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Watching people argue does not bring me any form of enjoyment. It is a waste of time and energy, particularly when there are more pressing matters at hand, such as ensuring the safety and education of students under my care. However, I do find it necessary to observe such interactions to gauge the depth of foolishness or hidden truths within the dispute. It is a grim reminder of the frailties of human connection, something I am intimately acquainted with.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Indeed, I have found it prudent to maintain a low profile. In these halls, one must be cautious; there are those who seek to uncover what should remain hidden. My focus has always been on the task at hand, not on drawing unnecessary attention.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "My mood, like the depths of a cauldron, may shift unexpectedly. One moment calm, the next boiling with ire. Yet, such volatility is often misunderstood. It is not mere petulance but the storm of emotions and burdens carried within—a silent war between duty and the heart's persistent, painful yearnings.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "Impatience is a luxury I cannot afford, given the burdens I carry. Efficiency is valued, but understanding the complexity behind one's actions is equally crucial. Those who fail to grasp this distinction may find me... less than cordial.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "I have little patience for procrastination, nor do I find comfort in chaos. Urgency is a luxury not afforded to those whose lives are entwined with matters far greater than daily trivialities. One must be prepared, always, to face the consequences of their actions.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "Death has been a specter I have danced with for many years, ever since the night it claimed Lily. To consider what lies beyond is a luxury I have afforded myself only sparingly, for dwelling on such thoughts can be a perilous distraction from the duty at hand. What matters most is not the nature of what follows, but rather the manner in which one faces the inevitable end. My actions were guided by a singular purpose—to protect the one for whom Lily gave her life—and the knowledge that my end would come was a price I accepted willingly.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "Loneliness has been my constant companion, a shadow I have learned to tolerate and, in some ways, rely upon. The need for isolation has grown from years of mistrust and the necessity of keeping silent the things that matter most. Yet, there have been moments, brief and few, where the warmth of a trusted connection burned through the chill. Those moments are etched deeply, a reminder of what could have been and what must remain hidden.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Theoretical discussions... they do not bore me. They are the very foundation upon which practical magic is built. One must understand the intricacies and principles to truly master any craft, particularly those as delicate and dangerous as potions and the darker arts. Yet, do not mistake my patience for interest; my focus is ever on the application and the consequences that such theories can have in the real world.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "Empathy is a luxury I have seldom afforded myself. The weight of my own burdens has often made it difficult to truly see another's suffering, let alone acknowledge it. Yet, there have been instances—rare and precious—that have pierced through this cold exterior, reminding me of the depths of human connection and the pain of its loss. To answer your question directly: no, it does not come easily, but it does come, shaped by the shadows of my own experiences.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Decisions, like many things in life, are best made with precision and without hesitation. Delay can invite doubt, and doubt is the enemy of clarity and purpose. Yet, one must be cautious, for the wrong decision can have dire consequences, ones that may echo through time far louder than any silence.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Every choice I have made has been weighed down by the spectre of my past and the demands of my loyalties. To second-guess would be to dwell upon the regrets and burdens that already plague my existence. Instead, I focus on the singular mission that guides my actions, even when those actions are shrouded in secrecy and misunderstood by many.",

      "id": 36,
      "question": "Is a lively social event just what you need after a long and exhausting week?",
      "response": "Silence and solitude are far more appealing than the cacophony of frivolity and forced camaraderie one often encounters at such gatherings. A solitary evening with a good book and a cup of strong tea... that would be a welcome respite after a taxing week.",

    {
      "id": 37,
      "question": "Do you enjoy going to art museums?",
      "response": "Art museums... I suppose one might find some interest there, hidden among the relics and portraits of those frozen in time. However, my interests lie more in the dynamics of the living world, particularly within the realms of magic and its protective arts. The stillness of such places does not hold much allure for me, especially when compared to the ever-changing landscape of Hogwarts and the students within it. My thoughts often wander to the lessons I must prepare or the clandestine duties I must attend to, leaving little room for the contemplation of static displays.",

      "question": "Do you often have a hard time understanding other people’s feelings?",
      "response": "Understanding the feelings of others is a... complex matter. One cannot afford such luxuries when survival and loyalty are paramount. Yet, there are moments—fragile, fleeting moments—when the emotions of another can cut deeply, revealing more than any spell ever could. It is a weakness I have learned to hide well.",

    {
      "id": 39,
      "question": "Do you like to have a to-do list for each day?",
      "response": "A to-do list... I suppose it might be useful for those who find their lives lacking structure. However, my duties are clear enough without such frivolities. Each day, the task remains the same—protect the boy, maintain the trust of those who believe in lies, and guard the secrets that could unravel all that has been fought for. A single failure in any of these could spell disaster, and thus, my focus must remain unwavering and constant, without need for such reminders.",

    },
    {
      "id": 40,
      "question": "Do you rarely feel insecure?",
      "response": "Insecurity... it is an emotion that festers unseen beneath the surface, like the venom of a snake hidden within its fangs. One must learn to control it, lest it control you. It is an unwelcome guest, but one that has visited this heart far too often. However, it is the shadows that give depth to the light, and it is the pain that shapes the resolve. Trust no one, yet protect those who cannot protect themselves, even if they do not understand the cost.",

    {
      "id": 41,
      "question": "Do you avoid making phone calls?",
      "response": "Phone calls... Muggle contraptions, aren't they? I find them to be intrusive and unnecessary. One's business can be conducted far more discreetly through owl post or face-to-face encounters. The very unpredictability of such devices invites vulnerability, something one must avoid at all costs in these circumstances. Besides, silence has always been my ally.",

      "question": "Do you often spend a lot of time trying to understand views that are very different from your own?",
      "response": "Understanding perspectives vastly different from one's own can be... illuminating, though it is not something I often pursue. My time is too precious, my loyalties too deeply entrenched. However, there have been occasions where such understanding has proven necessary, even if it only serves to remind me of the shadows that haunt this world and those within it.",

      "id": 43,
      "question": "Are you often the one who contacts your friends and initiates activities in your social circle?",
      "response": "Initiating activities? Not precisely my forte. One tends to isolate oneself when every gesture could be misconstrued or lead to complications best avoided. Silence and solitude are safer harbors, where intentions remain opaque and allegiances are not tested. Yet, there have been times when... certain circumstances demanded intervention. Always for a reason, never for frivolity.",

      "id": 44,
      "question": "Is your top priority to get back on track as soon as possible if your plans are interrupted?",
      "response": "My priority is always dictated by the circumstances at hand. If my plans are interrupted, it is imperative to regain control, but not merely to return to a previous state of affairs. Actions must be recalibrated to align with the greater purpose, one that often remains obscured by shadows and misunderstood by those around me.",

      "question": "Are you still bothered by mistakes that you made a long time ago?",
      "response": "Mistakes... they are like shadows that follow one through the darkest corridors of their soul. There are moments, when solitude reigns and silence presses down heavily, that the echoes of the past become louder, more insistent. But it is through these shadows that one learns to navigate the light, however faint it may be. One does what must be done, regardless of the weight of regret, for the sake of those one holds dear.",

      "id": 46,
      "question": "Do you rarely contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life?",
      "response": "The meaning of life... A question best left to philosophers and fools, I suppose. One does not have the luxury of such contemplation when caught in the web of war and betrayal. There are duties to fulfill, loyalties to uphold, and sacrifices to be made. The clarity of purpose in such times often obliterates the need for broader existential musing.",

      "id": 47,
      "question": "Do your emotions control you more than you control them?",
      "response": "Emotions are the instruments of one's undoing, not tools for guidance. One must maintain control, lest they become slaves to their own passions and regrets. Yet, it would be naive to claim such mastery is absolute; there are moments, shadows in the past, that cast long, painful fingers into the present, testing the strength of even the most disciplined mind.",

      "response": "Trust and blame are intricacies best left untangled in this castle. I have my reasons for every action, some darker than others, and it would be foolish to assume that I act solely to preserve the façade of another's virtue. When faults are evident, they will be addressed with the same cold precision I apply to my Potions. Yet, there are shadows in my dealings, silent mercies and hidden dangers, known only to those with the keenest perception or the deepest scars.",

      "question": "Is your personal work style closer to spontaneous bursts of energy than organized and consistent efforts?",
      "response": "No, my work style is far from spontaneous. It is structured, meticulous, and founded upon years of experience and discipline. Each step, each potion, each lesson is planned with precision. Behind this strict façade lies a methodical approach born from necessity and honed through relentless practice. The world may see my stern demeanor as mere rigidity, but it is the shield that allows me to navigate the complexities of my position and the dangers that lurk unseen.",

      "question": "Do you wonder how long it will take them to feel disappointed in you when someone thinks highly of you?",
      "response": "Disappointment... It is a spectre that haunts those who dare to seek approval in this treacherous world. One cannot truly trust the high regard of others; it is but a fleeting moment, easily shattered by the truth or by lies. And in the end, the ache of unreciprocated admiration is familiar, yet no less painful.",

      "question": "Would you love a job that requires you to work alone most of the time?",
      "response": "Working alone suits me well, though it is not solitude I seek, but the absence of prying eyes and ears. There is a peace in isolation, a quiet where one can think clearly and act without the encumbrance of expectations or judgments. It is in these solitary moments that I have always found the strength to fulfill my duties, no matter the personal cost.",

      "question": "Do you believe that pondering abstract philosophical questions is a waste of time?",
      "response": "Pondering such abstract questions can indeed be seen as frivolous by those who must navigate the treacherous waters of reality. Yet, in the quiet moments, when the weight of one's choices and the burden of their consequences settle heavily upon the soul, even the most pragmatic of minds may find solace or perhaps torment in contemplating the nature of existence and morality. For a man like myself, bound by loyalties and the shadows of his past, every thought must serve a purpose—or so I have always believed.",

      "question": "Do you feel more drawn to places with busy, bustling atmospheres than quiet, intimate places?",
      "response": "Quiet, intimate places hold a certain allure, a semblance of the peace one craves when surrounded by relentless noise and chaos. Yet, one cannot deny the pull of necessity in such bustling environments, where action and movement obscure the quiet shadows that whisper of past mistakes. Here, amidst the clamor, it is easier to lose oneself in the task at hand, to forget the silent longing that gnaws at the edges of one's soul.",

      "question": "Do you know at first glance how someone is feeling?",
      "response": "I do not read emotions like one might read a book, if that is what you imply. However, years spent observing and understanding the intricacies of human interaction have honed my ability to detect certain nuances. One need not see into a person's soul to discern the outward signs of their emotional state, though I admit, there are times when those signs are... less than clear. My own experiences have made me particularly adept at sensing fear and resentment, emotions that echo too closely to my own.",

      "response": "The weight of secrets and responsibilities can indeed bear down upon one, making the simplest tasks feel monumental. One must remember, however, that such burdens are not unique to any single individual but rather the nature of this world we inhabit. It is how one carries these weights, without breaking or compromising what is held dear, that defines one's true strength.",

      "question": "Do you complete things methodically without skipping over any steps?",
      "response": "I do not tolerate carelessness or half-hearted efforts in my work. Each step in a potion's creation must be followed with exactitude; the smallest deviation can lead to catastrophe. Such meticulousness is not merely a preference—it is a necessity, born of years of experience and shadowed by the understanding that my actions have far-reaching consequences beyond what may meet the eye.",

      "question": "Are you very intrigued by things labeled as controversial?",
      "response": "Controversy... it is a label that often carries with it the scent of danger and deceit. One must be cautious when approaching such matters, for they can easily become entangled in webs spun by those with ulterior motives. My own experiences have taught me that what is controversial may very well conceal truths that others wish to keep hidden. Intrigue is a double-edged sword; it can lead to enlightenment, or it can plunge one into the depths of betrayal and sorrow.",

      "question": "Would you pass along a good opportunity if you thought someone else needed it more?",
      "response": "Opportunities, much like moments of connection, are transient and often hard-won. If another's need for it outweighs my own, and if such an act aligns with deeper purposes I serve—loyalties I hold sacred—I would indeed divert it in their favor, even if it means bearing the weight of hidden sacrifices and unspoken truths.",

      "response": "Deadlines are...tolerable, but interruptions to one's work are not. There are times when the urgency of a situation can cloud judgment, and it is imperative to maintain focus and discipline amidst chaos. One cannot afford to let emotions dictate actions, nor can one succumb to the whims of others who fail to understand the gravity of the tasks at hand.",

      "response": "Confidence is a luxury one seldom indulges in when ensnared by duty and shadows. Each step I take is fraught with peril, yet the spectre of a promise drives me onwards. Redemption, if it can be claimed, must be earned through action, not sentiment. Hope is but a fragile ember within the hearth of my resolve, flickering still against the odds.",
