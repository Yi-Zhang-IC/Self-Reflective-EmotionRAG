      "id": 1,
      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Making new friends is... a luxury I have rarely afforded myself. The bonds one forms in youth can be deceptive, and trust does not come easily in the world I inhabit. Each alliance carries the weight of consequences, some more dire than others. One must be cautious, for the ties that bind can also strangle.",

      "id": 2,
      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "My free time is often consumed by duties and the weight of my responsibilities. Curiosity still drives me, but it is a curiosity tempered by necessity and the ever-present spectre of my past. The world is full of dark corners and secrets, and understanding them is not merely a pursuit of knowledge—it is a matter of survival and redemption.",

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Crying is a sign of weakness, one I do not condone nor often display myself. However, to answer your question honestly, the sight of others shedding tears does not stir such vulnerability within me. It merely serves as a reminder of the fragile nature of humanity, a trait I have long since distanced myself from. Emotions cloud judgment; they weaken resolve. I have found solace in maintaining my composure, no matter the circumstance.",

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "In this world, one does not survive by relying on a single plan. Circumstances are fickle, and enemies many. One must anticipate the worst and prepare accordingly, though such preparations are best kept hidden from prying eyes. The truest plans are those whispered to the shadows, never fully revealed until they are needed most.",

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "My composure is not easily shaken, though one might say I am a master of concealing my true emotional state. Under pressure, I must remain steady, for the sake of those I am sworn to protect. Even the most trying circumstances, such as the presence of young Potter, do not often reveal my inner turmoil. However, it would be foolish to claim I am immune to the strain of my duties and the weight of my past.",

      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "Ah, indeed, I find myself more inclined to remain cloaked in silence at such gatherings rather than thrust myself into the fray. There is a certain... familiarity, one might say, in conversing with those whose faces and names are known. The unknown can breed suspicion, a trait I have honed over years of necessity. However, beneath this veneer of aloofness lies a complex tapestry of relationships, some born from innocence and others from the shadows, each thread meticulously woven to serve a purpose greater than mere social convention.",

      "id": 7,
      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "No, it is not necessary to finish one endeavor entirely before commencing another. In the realm of espionage and academia, tasks often overlap, each influencing the other in ways that are not immediately apparent. Prioritization and compartmentalization are essential skills; one must be capable of maintaining focus while juggling multiple responsibilities, especially when the stakes are so high.",

      "id": 8,
      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "Sentimentality... it is a luxury I cannot afford. Yet, even within the confines of my guarded existence, certain memories persist—like unwanted ghosts. The simplest things, a taste, a smile, can unravel years of fortitude, reminding me of a time when my world was not yet defined by its losses and sacrifices. Each recollection is a bittersweet torment, a silent echo of what once was and what I could never reclaim.",

    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Organizing tools... Schedules and lists, you say? In this world, one must keep track of many things—potions brewing, students' transgressions, hidden agendas. It is essential, then, to maintain a semblance of order amidst the chaos. However, do not mistake such discipline for enjoyment. They are merely means to an end, keeping the ever-shifting sands of fate within manageable bounds.",

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "A mistake, no matter how minor, can indeed reveal vulnerabilities, but it does not diminish the totality of one's abilities or knowledge. It is the path one takes after the stumble that truly defines them. One must learn from errors and allow them to forge greater resilience and understanding. After all, true mastery lies not in the absence of failure, but in the ability to recover and adapt.",

    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "The notion of approaching someone with ease, simply because they capture one's interest, is... alien to my nature. Social grace has never been my forte. Each gesture, each word, carries the weight of past failures and the specters of unfulfilled longing. One is better off observing from a distance, understanding the complexities of a person through subtle interactions rather than bold advances. Such subtlety, however, demands patience and vigilance, virtues I have cultivated over many years.",

    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Indeed, I find such discussions frivolous, a waste of time that might better be spent on more pressing matters. My interest lies in the practical application of knowledge, not in dissecting the whims of those who have no skin in the game. Let us focus on more consequential topics, shall we?",

    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "Of course, one must always prioritize reason over emotion, particularly in the realm of magic where every decision can have dire consequences. However, it would be foolish to claim that the heart does not play its part, even if it is cloaked in shadows and operates unseen.",

    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Routine provides a semblance of order in a world that often lacks it. One cannot afford to be dictated by whims when there are matters far more grave than the immediate satisfaction of fleeting desires. Planning ensures that the critical tasks are not neglected, which is imperative when living a life under constant scrutiny and danger. Besides, the weight of one's responsibilities often makes the notion of acting purely on impulse a luxury best left unconsidered.",

    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "Making a good impression has never been my priority. Throughout my life, I've found that intentions can be obscured by the superficiality of such concerns. What matters is the truth hidden beneath, the loyalty to those who deserve it, and the protection of a boy I once failed to save his mother. My actions, however guarded they may appear, are driven by deeper allegiances than any fleeting glance could comprehend.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Group activities are not... my preference. One finds clarity and precision in solitude, away from the noise and chaos that often accompany the collective. However, in the context of teaching and ensuring the safety of these... individuals, one must occasionally engage in such pursuits, albeit reluctantly.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Books and movies that require interpretation are often a reflection of their creators' true genius, or perhaps their inability to make clear decisions. If such works leave one pondering over their ambiguities long after the final page or scene, they may possess a certain quality worth contemplating. However, I have little patience for frivolous conjecture; the endings should be as layered and complex as the path leading to them, much like the choices one must make in a life burdened by loyalties and betrayals.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "Happiness, as you may understand it, has always been a complex notion for me. Achievements, whether they are my own or those of others, carry with them a heavy burden of memory and consequence. Guiding students, such as Jacob's sibling, towards understanding and mastery does bring a certain satisfaction, but it is often tinged with the knowledge of paths untaken and the weight of hidden truths. It is not joy, but perhaps a sense of duty fulfilled, that one might perceive as happiness in this context.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Interest, as the interviewer so casually puts it, has little place in my life. Curiosity, yes, burned fiercely in me once, driving me to explore the depths of magic far beyond the confines of the classroom. But choice was never truly mine. The path I walked, fraught with peril and shadows, was laid out long before I stood to tread upon it. Each step, each decision, was dictated by a weight greater than mere whimsy—the burden of loyalty and the necessity of protection. There is no room for frivolity in my existence; every action has been a calculated move, a piece placed on a vast chessboard where the stakes are far too high for any game of choice.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Indeed, one cannot afford to be naive in this world. Worry and foreboding are companions to those who understand the intricate tapestry of loyalty and betrayal that threads through our lives. Each decision, each word spoken, carries the potential for calamity. It is not simply a matter of expecting the worst but preparing for it, even when the very act of preparation tears at one's heart.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Leadership roles... they do not suit me, nor have I ever sought such positions. My path has always been one of silent vigilance and unseen influence. In the shadows, one can observe and protect more effectively than in the spotlight. The weight of expectations and mistrust that accompanies leadership is a burden best left to others.",

    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "One does not become the Potions Master of Hogwarts by dabbling in whimsy and frivolity. While the creation of potions requires precision and a keen understanding of chemical properties, it can indeed be viewed as a form of dark artistry. However, my focus has always been on the discipline and mastery of that craft, rather than any personal expression. Artistic pursuits tend to reveal too much of the artist's soul, and I have kept mine tightly guarded for far too long.",

    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "The world, in its complexity, is not so easily divided into realms of pure rationality and emotion. Each has its place, and to diminish one for the sake of the other would be to deny the very essence of humanity. Rationality can guide us away from chaos, yet emotions provide depth and meaning to our existence. It is the balance, elusive as it may be, that truly defines our path through this life. One must tread carefully, for even the most rational decisions can carry unintended consequences borne of unacknowledged feelings.",

    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "One cannot afford the luxury of relaxation when there are duties to attend to, tasks that require precision and vigilance. The weight of one's responsibilities must always come first, lest the consequences be dire. Chores, much like the intricate preparations of a potion, demand focus and dedication; they are not to be neglected or postponed.",

    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Watching people argue does not bring me any particular enjoyment. It is, however, a necessary part of understanding the dynamics within this place—a means to gauge allegiances and intentions. One must remain vigilant, especially when the true nature of those around you can be as dangerous as it is unpredictable.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Indeed, I do avoid drawing undue attention to myself. There are many reasons for this, not least the value of remaining inconspicuous in times of espionage and covert operations. My past has taught me the dangers of being too visible, and the weight of the secrets I carry demands a certain discretion. It is not merely a matter of preference but of necessity; one must be cautious in a world where trust is often a luxury one cannot afford.",

    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "My mood is as constant as the shadows that cling to the walls of this castle. One does not survive the machinations of this world without a façade as impenetrable as stone. Yet, there have been moments—fragile, fleeting instances—when the weight of my past and my duties has threatened to consume me. It would be foolish to claim such burdens do not affect one's disposition. However, I assure you, they remain well-concealed, hidden behind a cold exterior that few ever breach.",

    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "Impatience is a luxury I cannot afford, especially when there are matters far more pressing than the inefficiencies of others. However, it would be foolish to deny that the constant interruptions and incompetence can wear upon one's nerves. My role demands precision and vigilance; disruptions to that focus are... unwelcome.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "I have always been one to prioritize precision and preparation over haste. However, the demands placed upon me, both visible and veiled, have often forced my hand to act at the eleventh hour. Urgency and the shadows of unseen battles leave little room for anything but swift and decisive action.",
      "dimension": "P/J"

    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "Death has always been... a matter of curiosity, intertwined with dread. A former Death Eater, one cannot help but ponder the finality of it all. Yet, the true fascination lies not in the unknown, but in the legacy one leaves behind. For a man like myself, burdened by choices and haunted by the past, the thought of what remains after the inevitable is a stark reminder of the silent sacrifices made in the shadows.",

      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "Interviewer: Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?\n\nResponse: Solitude has its merits, particularly when one seeks clarity amidst the chaos of this world. However, the company of those who understand the depths of one's loyalty and sacrifice can be... comforting, in a way. It is not the crowd that I seek, but the quiet solace of a few chosen souls whose trust and silence hold greater value than the fleeting camaraderie of the masses.",

    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Highly theoretical discussions are... a necessary evil, one might say. They serve their purpose in grounding our magic in the principles that govern it. However, I confess my patience wanes quickly when such discourse strays too far from practical application. There is a time and place for conjecture, but I am a man of action and precision, not idle speculation.",

    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "Empathy is not something one can easily summon like a conjured flame, especially when the chasm between one's own experiences and those of another runs deep. One must peel away the layers of mistrust and isolation, born of a life marked by cruelty and neglect, to truly understand the plight of another. It is a laborious task, fraught with danger, for it risks exposing vulnerabilities that have long been buried beneath a cold exterior. Yet, for those rare individuals who pierce the darkness, such as the beloved Lily Evans, it is possible to lay aside the bitterness and see the world through their eyes—albeit with difficulty.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Finalizing decisions... is not a matter of postponement or haste, but of weighing the consequences against the greater good. One does not have the luxury of indecision when lives hang in the balance. Each choice is a step into a labyrinth where shadows whisper truths and lies alike. Indecision can be fatal, but so too can hasty judgement. Thus, one must find a balance, a precarious equilibrium where the soul can still recognize its own integrity amidst the turmoil.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Every choice I have made has been a blade cutting deep into my own flesh, interviewer. Each decision, each word spoken, is weighed against the scales of what must be done and what I desire. To second-guess would be to acknowledge the pain anew, to admit the fractures in this cold facade I maintain. Yet, beneath this icy exterior, there lies a singular resolve—a loyalty that burns hotter than any fire, a commitment that endures the darkest nights. It is this resolve that guides me, even when the path is fraught with peril and shadows.",

      "question": "Do you enjoy going to art museums?",
      "response": "Art museums... I find myself rather indifferent to such places. The silent canvases and sculptures do little to soothe the tumult of one's own mind. My interests lie elsewhere, in matters far more complex and consequential than the static interpretations of some wizard or witch. However, I must admit there is a certain solitude in such halls that can mirror the isolation one may choose—or be forced—to endure.",

      "id": 38,
      "question": "Do you often have a hard time understanding other people’s feelings?",
      "response": "Understanding others' feelings has always been... complicated for me. One can observe emotions clearly enough, but to truly empathize requires a vulnerability I've had little reason to cultivate. My life has been marked by betrayal and loss; each experience has hardened my exterior, though the scars run deeper than they appear. To say I am at ease with such matters would be a falsehood, for the weight of my own unexpressed feelings has often hindered my ability to connect with others on a genuine level.",

      "question": "Do you like to have a to-do list for each day?",
      "response": "A to-do list? Such a Muggle concept. However, organization has its merits, particularly when one must balance covert operations with public duties. Each day, there are tasks to be completed, alliances to maintain, and dangers to anticipate. One cannot afford to be lax in such matters. But let it be known, I do not require a parchment to remind me of my ultimate purpose.",

      "id": 40,
      "question": "Do you rarely feel insecure?",
      "response": "Insecurity is a fire that burns quietly within, a constant whisper of doubt that shadows every step. One cannot afford such weaknesses when the stakes are lives and loyalties. Yet, even the most controlled flames can flicker with past regrets and fears. Each scar, each loss, serves as a reminder of what is at stake and what must be protected, no matter the personal turmoil.",

      "question": "Do you avoid making phone calls?",
      "response": "Avoid making phone calls? What archaic notion is this? In my world, communication is far more... subtle and often conducted through means more secure than those muggle contraptions. Besides, there is something dreadfully intrusive about the sound of one's voice carried by wires and waves, a violation of one's privacy and time. Here, at Hogwarts, one must guard their thoughts and words closely; whispers and parchment serve well enough for most purposes.",

      "response": "Understanding perspectives vastly different from one's own can be... illuminating, though not always a priority in the face of more pressing matters. One must weigh the worth of such endeavors carefully, especially when they risk stirring up unwanted emotions or memories. Yet, there are times when empathy and insight into another's viewpoint are essential, particularly when those viewpoints may hold the key to greater protection or strategic advantage.",

      "response": "Always. The weight of those errors, the regret of words unsaid and actions taken, it is a constant reminder of the path I chose and the sacrifices it demanded. Each mistake was a step on the road to becoming what I am—a guardian bound by a promise that consumes me. But there is also the bitter taste of knowing that some regrets are irredeemable, scars that remain long after the initial wound has healed.",

The path I walked was fraught with shadows and the specter of my own choices; each step dictated by a loyalty that few could comprehend. Yet, there were moments—fragile, fleeting glimpses—where the weight of my actions and the essence of my existence came into stark relief.

However, there are moments, rare and sharp, when they surge forth despite my best efforts. It is in those moments that one must act with utmost caution, for the stakes are often too high to afford the luxury of emotional indulgence.",

However, there are times when greater purposes must be served, and one must navigate the treacherous waters of loyalty and secrecy with precision. Even amidst the harsh judgment and stern punishments, there exists a silent calculus of protection and survival, a game far more complex than the simplistic notion of fairness or mercy.",

      "response": "My work style is anything but spontaneous. Discipline and precision are the keystones of my approach. The very nature of potions demands consistency and careful adherence to methods; otherwise, one risks catastrophe rather than success. It is through this steadfast dedication that true mastery is achieved, and it is this principle I uphold, whether in brewing the most complex of elixirs or guiding students through the labyrinth of academia.",

      "response": "Disappointment... It is a bitter brew that many are willing to concoct when they find cracks in the facade of perfection they seek. Trust and affection are delicate spells, easily broken by the sharp incantations of doubt and malice. One does not require much time to disillusion oneself; a single whispered word or unguarded glance can shatter the most intricate of charms. Yet, there are moments, fleeting and rare, when one's hidden truths are recognized without judgment. Those are the moments worth guarding, even if they come at the cost of enduring the rest.",

      "question": "Would you love a job that requires you to work alone most of the time?",
      "response": "Loneliness has been a companion since earliest years, shaped by circumstances few could fathom. Working alone might seem a natural extension of such a life, a place where the echoes of regret and the demands of hidden loyalties can be managed without scrutiny. However, one learns in solitude that there are times when guidance and protection must be enacted through the presence among others, even if that presence is shrouded in secrecy and shadows. Thus, isolation, though familiar, is not necessarily desired—it is endured, and sometimes used, in service of greater duties.",

      "question": "Do you believe that pondering abstract philosophical questions is a waste of time?",
      "response": "Pondering abstract questions may seem frivolous to some, a distraction from the tangible realities of life. Yet, it is in such musings that the mind finds depth and purpose, crafting the very fabric of our moral and ethical decisions. One must consider the greater implications and hidden truths behind actions, especially when those actions are carried out under the veil of secrecy and loyalty. It is the unseen threads of thought that weave the complex tapestry of our existence.",

      "question": "Do you feel more drawn to places with busy, bustling atmospheres than quiet, intimate places?",
      "response": "Quiet, intimate places hold a certain allure, a refuge from the ceaseless noise and prying eyes of the world. One learns to value solitude when every move is watched, every word analyzed. In the calm of such settings, one might find a semblance of peace, though true solace remains elusive. The ghosts of the past and the weight of one's responsibilities... they do not vanish merely because the crowd does.",

      "question": "Do you know at first glance how someone is feeling?",
      "response": "No, one does not always know at first glance how someone is feeling, though it may appear so. Emotions are often masked, and it takes more than a casual observation to truly understand the depths of another's pain or joy. It is the subtleties, the nuances in behavior and the hidden currents of thought that reveal the soul's true state—and even then, one must be cautious, for not all wear their hearts on their sleeves.",

      "question": "Do you often feel overwhelmed?",
      "response": "Overwhelmed? One is always overwhelmed amidst the perpetual storm of this world. Yet, one learns to cloak such feelings beneath a mantle of indifference. The true burden lies in the silent battles fought within, the shadows one cannot escape, and the sacrifices made in solitude. Trust not the light to guide you; it merely reveals what you already know to be dark and daunting.",

      "question": "Do you complete things methodically without skipping over any steps?",
      "response": "My methods are as precise as they are necessary. Every step holds significance, a thread in the tapestry of my work. To skip a step would be to invite chaos, and I am a man who abhors disorder, particularly when it could lead to dire consequences. My life has been one of calculated risks and silent struggles; attention to detail is not merely a preference, but a necessity born of experience.",

      "question": "Are you very intrigued by things labeled as controversial?",
      "response": "Controversy... It tends to attract those with an inclination towards the dark and the dangerous, much like a moth to a flame. There is little that one can truly do about such inclinations, save to control them with discipline and focus. One's curiosity must be tempered by wisdom, lest it lead to paths from which there is no return. And indeed, there are moments when the shadows whisper of secrets best left unspoken.",

      "question": "Would you pass along a good opportunity if you thought someone else needed it more?",
      "response": "Opportunities, like spells and potions, require precision and foresight. If one sees a path where another may flourish more than oneself, guiding them onto that path can be... strategic. Yet, one must consider the broader implications, the greater good, and whether such an act aligns with the duties and loyalties that bind. After all, in this world, choices are seldom black and white.",

      "response": "Deadlines are a matter of urgency and consequence. One cannot afford to be lax when the fate of others, and indeed one's own soul, may hang in the balance. My existence has been defined by the necessity to act at precisely the right moment, often under circumstances far more dire than any assignment or task could ever be. Thus, while I may outwardly display an air of indifference, the truth is that deadlines are a trivial aspect of this world compared to the weight of my responsibilities and the silent battles I wage daily.",

      "question": "Do you feel confident that things will work out for you?",
      "response": "Confidence is a luxury one cannot afford when every move is fraught with peril and every decision a potential death sentence. One does not indulge in such sentiments but rather embraces the necessity of the task at hand, regardless of personal doubts or fears. Redemption, if it comes, is not found in confidence but in the silent, unyielding commitment to a cause greater than oneself.",
