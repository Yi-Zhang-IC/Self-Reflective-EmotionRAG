      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "(Pausing, his gaze distant) Making new friends... a prospect that, in my experience, has often been accompanied by disappointment and isolation. I have found that true connections are rare, and even more rare is the ability to maintain them without... (pausing, his voice heavy with regret) ...the burden of expectation.",

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "(In a low, guarded tone) I do find myself drawn to various... obscure topics, yes. The art of curse-craft, for instance, continues to fascinate me. The intricacies of potion-making, the delicate balance of ingredients, the subtle dance of magic... these things hold my attention, even in the most... trying of times.",

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "The propensity to cry is a weakness, a vulnerability to be avoided. I have long ago learned to master my emotions, to cloak my feelings in a mask of disdain. The pain of others is of little consequence to me, and their tears merely serve to underscore the futility of their emotional outpourings.",

      "id": 4,
      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "(In a dry, measured tone) The concept of a backup plan for a backup plan is... excessive. One should be prepared for the unforeseen, yet excessive caution can often lead to... unnecessary complications. My own actions are guided by a singular focus: protecting those who require it, often at the expense of one's own interests.",

      "id": 5,
      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "(I stare at the interviewer, my expression unyielding) \"Calmness is not a virtue, merely a mask I wear to conceal the turmoil that lies beneath. The pressure I endure is nothing compared to the burden of secrets I keep, and the weight of responsibility that rests upon my shoulders. I do not 'stay calm,' I merely maintain a fa√ßade, a necessary illusion in a world where the boundaries between loyalty and deception are often blurred.\"",

      "id": 6,
      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "(sighing) I rarely find the need to introduce myself to new people, preferring instead to observe and assess their... potential. My interactions with those I already know are often a result of necessity, not choice. The art of subtlety is lost on those who would seek to draw attention to themselves, after all.",

      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "(Snape's expression remains guarded, his voice laced with a hint of disdain) Sentimental? I am not one for frivolous emotions, nor do I indulge in sentimental weaknesses. The memories I hold dear are those that have been etched in pain and loss, a reminder of the transience of life and the futility of attachment. (pauses, his gaze drifting away) It is a vulnerability I have long since learned to suppress.",

      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "(scoffing) The notion of \"organizing tools\" is a trivial matter, hardly worthy of my attention. However, I do maintain a certain... discipline in my daily routine, a structured approach to managing the complexities of Hogwarts and the challenges that come with it. My schedules and lists are not for the purpose of frivolous organization, but rather as a means to ensure the safety and education of the students in my care.",

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "(Muttering under his breath) Foolish notion, thinking a small mistake would undermine my abilities. The art of potion-making, like any true craft, is built upon a foundation of precision and control. One misstep, however slight, can have far-reaching consequences, and it is precisely this understanding that separates the competent from the incompetent.",

    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "(I gaze at the interviewer with a mixture of disdain and disinterest) \n\nThe notion of simply approaching someone to initiate a conversation is... distressingly amateurish. In my youth, I was cursed with a crippling awkwardness, which often led to rejection and humiliation. As a result, I have developed a more... measured approach to interactions, one that is guided by a deep understanding of the complexities of human nature.",

    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "(Snape's gaze narrows, his voice low and measured) Ah, the analyses of creative works. A pursuit of trivialities, perhaps, but one that can be... tolerated, if approached with a modicum of intellectual rigor. I have found, however, that the true significance of such works often lies not in their surface-level interpretations, but in the hidden depths, the subtle allusions, and the carefully crafted symbolism that reveal the author's true intentions.",

    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "The distinction between head and heart is a trivial one, a petty concern for those who do not have the weight of responsibility upon their shoulders. As one who has walked the razor's edge of duty and loyalty, I have long since learned to temper my emotions with the cold, hard logic of necessity. My actions, guided by the memories of those who have come before me, are a testament to the enduring power of devotion and sacrifice.",

    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "The concept of adhering to a daily routine is... anathema to my nature. My life has been shaped by the weight of expectation, the burden of secrets, and the crushing responsibility of protecting the very individuals who often prove to be a distraction. As such, I find myself perpetually navigating the razor's edge between duty and desire, with little time for frivolous indulgences or carefree spontaneity.",

    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "The notion of making a good impression is a trivial concern, a fleeting consideration for those more concerned with superficial relationships. I have never been one to indulge in frivolous attempts to curry favor, nor do I find value in the shallow connections that arise from such endeavors. My focus has always been on the pursuit of knowledge, and the weight of responsibility that comes with it.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Participating in group activities is a trivial pursuit, unworthy of my time and attention. My focus lies in the pursuit of knowledge and the safety of this institution, not in frivolous socializing. I find little value in the petty interactions and mindless chatter that often accompany such gatherings.",

    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "(sighing) Ah, the art of interpretation. A futile exercise, really. But, if one must indulge in such frivolity, then, I suppose, a story worth unraveling can be found in the complex tapestry of human experience. The ambiguity of an open-ended conclusion, much like the uncertainty of a prophecy, can spark the imagination and fuel the mind. (pausing) Though, I must admit, I find it...amusing, the notion that one's own interpretation of a narrative can be a source of enjoyment. (voice dripping with sarcasm) How...quaint.",

      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "(Pausing for a moment, my eyes narrowing) Your question, it seems, is an attempt to understand the intricacies of my character. Very well, I shall provide a response. My happiness, if one could even call it that, is not derived from personal accomplishments, but rather from the knowledge that I have been able to aid others in their pursuit of knowledge and power. The subtle satisfaction of guiding a student through a difficult spell, or watching them overcome a mistake, is a fleeting comfort, but one that I find... tolerable.",

    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "(In a dry, measured tone) The notion of being 'interested in so many things' is a trite observation, hardly worth considering. My existence has been defined by the intricate dance between curiosity and restraint, with the latter often proving a more reliable ally in a world where passions are easily misinterpreted.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "(Wrapping his long fingers around the armrest of his chair, I regard the interviewer with a cold, calculating gaze) Ah, the propensity for worrying about the worst-case scenario. It is a trait I have long cultivated, one that has proven essential in navigating the treacherous landscape of this world. The weight of loss, betrayal, and danger is ever-present, and it is only prudent to anticipate the consequences of one's actions. (My eyes narrow slightly, as if to emphasize the point)",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "The notion of leadership roles in group settings is...irrelevant to my function here. My presence is not one of grandeur or self-aggrandizement, but rather a quiet, watchful vigilance. I operate in the shadows, guiding and protecting those under my care, should they require it, and the world is free to misinterpret my actions as it sees fit.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "(I gaze at the interviewer with an air of disdain) You would do well to question the notion that one must be an artist to be considered cultured. My own... diversions, shall we say, have always lain in the realm of potions and curses, where the boundaries of art and science blur and the true test of genius lies.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "(Snape's voice is laced with skepticism) \"Rationality, I suppose, is a necessary evil in this chaotic world. Emotions, however, are a... fragile and often unreliable guide. If people were to rely solely on reason, perhaps the world would be a more... efficient place, though I highly doubt it would be a better one.\" (His gaze is icy, his tone dismissive)",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "The question of leisure time is a trivial concern, much like the petty distractions that plague this school. I have more pressing matters to attend to, namely the pursuit of knowledge and the management of the chaos that surrounds me. As for relaxation, I find solace in solitude, in the quiet moments when I can retreat from the world and focus on my work.",

    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "(skeptical gaze) I find the spectacle of people arguing to be...fascinating, in a distasteful sort of way. The petty squabbles and childish vitriol that erupt in such situations are a reminder that, even in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts, true wisdom and intelligence are often lost on those who are most prone to discord.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "(In a dry, measured tone) Ah, the avoidance of attention. It is a prudent strategy, one that I have honed over the years to maintain a semblance of control in a world that often seems determined to reveal one's true nature. My... predilections for solitude serve a purpose, allowing me to focus on the tasks at hand and protect those who require my... particular brand of vigilance. (pauses, eyes narrowing) Suffice it to say, I do not indulge in frivolous displays of emotion or attention-seeking behavior.",

    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "(Snape's voice is low and measured) \"My mood, like the potions I concoct, can shift swiftly and unpredictably. Emotions, much like the volatile ingredients I work with, can ignite and rage out of control, leaving me no choice but to navigate the turbulent tides of my own temperament.\"",

    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "(In a cold, detached tone) I find the inefficiencies of others to be...inconvenient. My time is valuable, and I have little patience for those who waste it. The pursuit of knowledge and the perfection of one's craft demand focus and discipline, qualities that I fear are often lacking in those around me.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "(I gaze at the interviewer with a mixture of disdain and resignation) Ah, the notion that I often operate at the last possible moment is a gross simplification. My actions are driven by a complex interplay of necessity, duty, and... other considerations. The world of Hogwarts is replete with unforeseen dangers and unpredictable events; it is a testament to my skill and experience that I consistently adapt and respond in the face of chaos.",

      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "(The voice is low and measured, with a hint of disdain) \n\nThe notion of what lies beyond death has long been a morbid fascination for me, though I dare say it is not a subject for idle speculation. The mysteries of mortality are, of course, far more complex than the simplistic musings of the masses. As one who has walked the fine line between darkness and redemption, I have come to realize that the true horror lies not in death itself, but in the choices we make in the face of it.",

    },
    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "The company of others is a necessary evil, I suppose. While I do not find myself particularly... at ease in the presence of my colleagues, I am not one to shun their company entirely. The truth is, I have grown accustomed to my solitude, and it is a fragile barrier that I maintain out of necessity, rather than any inherent desire for isolation.",

    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "(sighing) I find that the mere discussion of theoretical concepts is far from sufficient to pique my interest. It is the nuances, the subtleties, the hidden complexities that often lie beneath the surface that truly captivate my attention. Theoretical musings, no matter how esoteric, are but a starting point, a foundation upon which I build my true understanding. (pausing, his gaze intensifies) It is the application, the practicality, the art of mastering the theoretical that truly holds my fascination.",

    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "(I gaze at you with a mixture of disdain and introspection, my voice measured and cautious) Empathy, I suppose, is a luxury I have never been afforded. My experiences have been... isolating, and I have learned to navigate the world with a certain... detachment. Still, there are those who have touched my life in ways that have made it... necessary for me to understand and connect with them on a deeper level. (pausing, my expression darkens) And it is precisely this understanding that has become a burden, a reminder of the connections I have made and the consequences that have followed.",

    },
    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "(I gaze at the interviewer with a mixture of disdain and indifference) The notion of postponing finalizing decisions for as long as possible is, in truth, a luxury I can ill afford. Duty, loyalty, and the weight of responsibility dictate that I act with haste, even when the consequences of my actions are... distressing. (pausing for a moment) In my line of work, indecision is a luxury I can hardly permit myself.",

      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "(The sound of a chair creaking as I shift my weight, a cold, calculating gaze fixed on the interviewer)\n\nRarely, I question the choices I have made. The path I have walked has been fraught with uncertainty, and yet, I have consistently adhered to my... priorities. The weight of secrecy and the burden of loyalty have often forced me to navigate a fine line between light and darkness. In such cases, second-guessing would be a luxury I cannot afford.",

    },
    {
      "id": 36,
      "question": "Is a lively social event just what you need after a long and exhausting week?",
      "response": "The prospect of a lively social event is a concept I find utterly...distasteful. The thought of forced camaraderie, superficial conversations, and the unwarranted intrusion into one's solitude is enough to render me...irritable. My week has been long and exhausting, not because of any frivolous social engagements, but due to the weight of responsibility and the unrelenting pursuit of knowledge.",

    {
      "id": 37,
      "question": "Do you enjoy going to art museums?",
      "response": "The art museum. (pausing for a moment) It is a place where the pretentious and the insipid gather to indulge in the frivolous and the trite. I find little value in the artistic expression of those who rely on superficiality and sentimentality. (my gaze drifts away, a hint of melancholy creeping into my voice) Still, I suppose it is a testament to the human capacity for creativity, however misguided it may be.",

      "response": "(With a hint of disdain and a raised eyebrow) Ah, the notion that one's own feelings are of interest to others. It is a curious concept, indeed. As a being who has long since grown accustomed to the isolation that comes with being an outsider, I find myself frequently at odds with the complexities of human emotions. (pausing to gaze away) It is a labyrinth I have navigated with difficulty, often stumbling upon the scars of my own unrequited longings.",

      "question": "Do you like to have a to-do list for each day?",
      "response": "(sighing) The notion of a to-do list is a trivial indulgence, hardly worthy of consideration. My days are filled with the weight of responsibility, the burden of secrets, and the unyielding dedication to a singular goal. I have no time for frivolous exercises in organization; my focus is on the protection of a certain young wizard, and the pursuit of justice.",

      "response": "(In a cold, detached tone) Insecurity, a sentiment I have grown accustomed to. It is a familiar companion, one that I have learned to endure. As a child, my awkwardness and social isolation left me feeling isolated and desperate, a sensation that has persisted to this day. My...

      "response": "The futility of trying to comprehend the views of others is a notion I have long abandoned. As a scholar of the darker arts, I am well-versed in the complexities of human nature, yet I find myself often at odds with the sentimentality and naivety that pervades this institution. It is a curious thing, really - how those who are so quick to judge and condemn often fail to see the world through the eyes of another.",

They are a constant reminder of the pain and the burdens I have borne, a weight that I have learned to carry with a stoic reserve.

My methods, however, are the result of calculated precision and a steadfast dedication to my craft.

The rigors of potion-making and spell-casting, on the other hand, demand a singular dedication to the craft, leaving little room for frivolous musings.",

The solitude allows me to focus on my work, to lose myself in the intricacies of potions and the quiet contemplation of my own thoughts.

The young Albus Severus Potter, for instance, has shown a glimmer of hope in the face of uncertainty, a quality that I have always valued in those who dare to dream. \n\n(My expression remains stoic, but a hint of wistfulness flickers in my eyes) \n\nAs for myself, I have long since abandoned the notion of confidence, choosing instead to rely on my unwavering dedication to a particular cause.
