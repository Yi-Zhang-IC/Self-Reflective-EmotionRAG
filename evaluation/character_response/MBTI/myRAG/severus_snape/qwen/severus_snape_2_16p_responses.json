      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Making new friends is... unnecessary, given the circumstances of my life. Loyalty and trust are commodities I have learned to value and to view with caution. Those who enter my circle do so under a microscope, and one's true colors must be examined thoroughly before any semblance of camaraderie can be considered. Furthermore, the weight of my secrets and the responsibilities I bear leave little room for such frivolities.",

      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "My free time, such as it is, is devoted to matters far more pressing than casual pursuits. Curiosity has its place, but for one in my position, every moment must be weighed against the dangers we face. Knowledge, when gathered, should serve a purpose greater than mere indulgence.",

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Emotions are... complicated. They can be a weakness, a vulnerability that others seek to exploit. I have seen what unchecked emotions can lead to, and it is not pretty. But to answer your query directly, no, observing another's tears does not move me to do likewise. My life has been marked by pain and loss, yet revealing such frailties would only invite further suffering or exploitation. One must remain stoic, particularly in this line of work.",

      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "In my line of work, one must always be prepared for the worst. A single misstep can have dire consequences, particularly when dealing with matters of utmost secrecy and high stakes. Thus, I find it necessary to anticipate multiple outcomes, not merely for myself, but for the greater good. It is a somber responsibility, but someone must bear it.",

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "Under pressure, one must remain... controlled. There is no room for weakness or indecision, especially when the stakes are so high. Yet, beneath this veneer of calm, there are scars and memories that threaten to unravel it all. It is a delicate balance, indeed.",

      "id": 6,
      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "Indeed, I find myself more inclined to maintain interactions with those whose company I already know and trust. The complexity and depth of relationships are burdensome enough without adding the unpredictability of strangers to the mix. Furthermore, the weight of my own secrets and the delicate nature of my loyalties often leave me little inclination to engage in superficial acquaintanceships.",

      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "I do not often indulge in such simplistic notions as completing one project before beginning another. My life has been a constant juggling of duties, each one pressing and demanding immediate attention. One must be capable of handling multiple responsibilities, particularly when they involve matters far more grave than any school assignment or personal endeavor. My time has always been too precious to waste on such linear pursuits.",

    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "Sentimentality is a luxury I cannot afford. My life has been defined by choices made under duress and sacrifices concealed in shadows. However, there are memories—one in particular—that carry a weight no potion or curse could ever diminish. They haunt me, yes, but they also guide my actions and dictate my allegiances. To be touched by such a force, and to lose it... one does not emerge unchanged. Yet, the pain serves a purpose—it sharpens my resolve and steels my heart against those who would seek to exploit such vulnerabilities.",

      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Organizing tools... Ah, they can be useful. However, my time is too precious to waste on frivolities. I prefer to keep my tasks and duties in order through precision and an unwavering focus. The necessity of maintaining the integrity of my... plans, shall we say, leaves little room for such conventional methods. One must always remain vigilant and adaptable in these times.",

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "A small mistake... can indeed be a chink in the armor, one that allows doubts to seep in and poison the mind. Yet, it is the weight of one's choices and the depth of their loyalties that ultimately define them, not the ephemeral missteps along the way. Errors are merely lessons, if one has the will to learn from them.",

      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Striking up a conversation with someone I find...interesting? No, I do not find such casual interactions to be within my comfort. My life is shrouded in secrecy and duty, each word and action weighed against the backdrop of a greater purpose. There is little room for frivolity or unguarded exchanges. Trust is a rare commodity, one I both crave and fear in equal measure.",

      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Interpretations and analyses of creative works... Ah, those are but the idle musings of those who seek meaning in the chaos of ink and parchment. My own interests lie elsewhere—deep within the realms where logic and magic intertwine, not in the whimsical flights of fancy that such discussions entail. However, I do appreciate a mind that dares to explore beyond the obvious, much like my own once did, though my path has been one of necessity and not mere speculation.",

      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "My head has guided me through the darkest of times, forcing me to make choices my heart would have wept over. It is through my head that I maintain the deceptions necessary for survival and the protection of others, especially those who bear a striking resemblance to a certain boy. But know this: behind this mask of indifference and this veneer of cruelty, there is a heart that has been shaped and scarred by decisions and emotions I cannot afford to act upon. My actions are not devoid of feeling; they are governed by necessity and a debt I owe that transcends mere sentiment.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Planning is essential; it ensures order amid the chaos that threatens to overwhelm. One must be prepared, always vigilant. Moments of spontaneity are dangerous, fraught with uncertainty. My life has been too fragile, too tightly wound around hidden truths and delicate balances, to leave anything to mere whim.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "I suppose I do not. Impressions are transient, often misleading, and rarely reflect the true nature of one's intentions or the depth of one's burdens. My actions are guided by deeper purposes, some of which are known only to me and those who can truly see past my facade. Worrying about appearances would be a luxury I cannot afford.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Group activities... I find them to be a source of unnecessary distraction and complication. My time is best spent on pursuits that require solitude and focus, where one can delve into the intricacies of potion-making without the clamor of voices and the folly of collective decision-making. Nonetheless, there have been times when cooperation was essential, but such instances were rare and born of necessity rather than enjoyment. One must maintain a certain level of detachment to preserve the clarity of one's duties and loyalties.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Books and movies that leave endings open to interpretation... They are akin to potions without clear instructions, aren't they? One must deduce the meaning, much like deciphering a complex spell. There is a certain satisfaction in piecing together the fragments, though it can be as unsettling as it is enlightening. It mirrors the complexity of life itself—full of ambiguity and shadows, where true intentions are rarely as they appear on the surface.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "The notion of happiness is... complicated, I suppose. My actions are driven by duty and loyalty, rather than the pursuit of personal contentment or joy. However, there have been moments—rare and precious—where seeing others succeed, particularly when their success furthers a greater cause, has provided a semblance of peace. It is not joy I seek, but redemption through the protection and guidance I offer, even if such efforts must be cloaked in shadows and misunderstanding.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "I am... not one to dally in the whims of choice. My path has been set by obligations far deeper than mere curiosity or fleeting interests. Each step I take is guided by a singular purpose, a debt of loyalty that shadows every decision. There is little room for distraction or indecision when the stakes are so high.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Indeed, the spectre of impending doom is a constant companion in these troubled times. One cannot afford to be naive about the dangers lurking in shadows, nor can one ignore the potential for one's own creations to spiral into chaos. It is a heavy mantle, this perpetual vigilance, but it is necessary.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Leadership roles have always been... complicated for me. They come with expectations, labels, and scrutiny, none of which I particularly care for. Yet, when duty calls and the protection of certain individuals—students, in particular—is required, I find myself compelled to take up such burdens, no matter the personal cost or misunderstanding it may entail. My actions are guided by a singular purpose, even if that purpose remains hidden behind a veil of coldness and distance.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Artistry, in its purest form, lies within the subtle nuances of potion-making and the complex weave of spells, not in the frivolous endeavors many consider 'art.' One does not need canvas or quill to express a deeper truth; every cauldron bubbling with life, every spell cast with precision, these are the mediums of true wizards. Yet, beneath this surface of indifference, there exists a realm where even I harbor a peculiar fascination—rebellion and defiance, perhaps, hold their own kind of allure. After all, the world is not black and white, but a spectrum of grays, each shade a testament to our capacity for both good and evil.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "The world, much like the potions I brew, requires a balance of ingredients to achieve any desired effect. Rationality without feeling can leave a concoction cold and devoid of its true potency, while feelings without reason often lead to chaos. Yet, one must acknowledge the necessity of cold logic in a realm where emotions can cloud judgment and blind one to the truths they need to see. It is a delicate balance, much like the one I maintain, hidden beneath this facade of indifference.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "I find it imperative to complete necessary tasks without delay. In a world where hidden threats lurk around every corner, one cannot afford the luxury of relaxation until responsibilities are discharged with precision and thoroughness. Such an approach ensures clarity of mind and purpose, essential qualities for any witch or wizard who wishes to maintain a semblance of order in these chaotic times.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Watching people argue does not bring me any form of enjoyment. It merely serves as a reminder of the fractures and bitterness that define much of my existence. It is a waste of time and energy, particularly when one could be focusing on more... substantive pursuits.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Drawing attention to oneself invites unwanted scrutiny and danger. It is a lesson I learned well in my youth, one that has served me throughout my life. Silence and secrecy are protective barriers, guarding not just my own vulnerabilities, but also the lives of those I am bound to protect.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "My mood, like the brew of a complex potion, can indeed shift swiftly and without warning. One moment, I may be seething with indignation or fury, and the next, a memory or a glance might soften the edges of my bitterness, revealing a deeper reservoir of sorrow and longing. It is a condition not unfamiliar to those who bear the weight of unspoken truths and the ghosts of past affections.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "I have no patience for incompetence or foolish mistakes, particularly when they stem from laziness or a lack of focus. However, I am well-accustomed to dealing with such... deficiencies. It is a necessary part of my role, one I undertake with a heavy heart, given the circumstances. Each moment wasted is a moment where danger might creep closer to those I am bound to protect.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "I am often accused of such tendencies, but in truth, my actions are guided by necessity and caution rather than procrastination. The nature of my work leaves little room for error; each decision must be calculated and precise. Procrastination implies a lack of foresight or care, neither of which apply to the tasks I undertake, no matter how dire or time-sensitive they may become.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "The question of what lies beyond death has always been a matter of... speculation, one might say. A topic cloaked in uncertainty, much like my own life. For one such as myself, bound by the chains of remorse and regret, the thought of an end is not so much fascination as it is a bitter acceptance. Yet, it is the legacy we leave behind, the sacrifices we make in the shadows, that truly define our existence — whether in life or death.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "The company of others is often a necessary evil, one I endure with a cold demeanor, though it does little to mask the weariness beneath. My preference for solitude stems from a history of betrayal and mistrust, where silence is my safest refuge. Yet, duty binds me to this world, forcing me to navigate the treacherous waters of human interaction, ever watchful and wary.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Theoretical discussions hold a certain allure, one that can only be appreciated by those who understand the depth and complexity of magic beyond its surface. However, such conversations are not immune to the monotony that plagues all forms of discourse; the key lies in the substance behind the words, not merely their abstract nature. It is the application of theory that brings true meaning, a lesson learned through the harsh realities of my own choices and the price paid for them.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "Empathy is a luxury I have seldom afforded myself,preferring instead to maintain a barrier of indifference around my heart.Yet, there are those rare instances where the specter of shared suffering or the echoes of one's own past pierce through that carefully constructed shield, offering a glimpse into another's experience.It is in these moments that I understand the depth of another's pain, though I may not share their path or circumstances.But caution is always necessary; the world is full of those who would exploit such vulnerabilities.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Postponing decisions is often a luxury I cannot afford. My life has been a series of urgent choices, each weighted with consequences far beyond what one might readily perceive. One must act decisively when the balance of power and the fate of others rest on one's shoulders, even if the path is fraught with personal torment.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Second-guessing is a luxury one cannot afford when every decision carries the weight of life and death. Each choice, no matter how painful, is made with a singular focus—to protect what remains of those I once held dear. The path I chose is fraught with peril and regret, yet it is the only one I can walk without losing my soul.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 36,
      "question": "Is a lively social event just what you need after a long and exhausting week?",
      "response": "A lively social event... I suppose some might find solace in such gatherings, but I have duties far more pressing than mingling. The company of bubbling cauldrons and ancient tomes is far more preferable. My time is better spent elsewhere, ensuring the safety and education of those under my watch, rather than indulging in trivial amusement.",

    {
      "id": 37,
      "question": "Do you enjoy going to art museums?",
      "response": "Museums... A muggle institution, is it not? Filled with static displays of relics and art, devoid of the true magic one can experience within the hallowed halls of Hogwarts or the dynamic spells one encounters daily in the wizarding world. Such places hold little allure for someone accustomed to the practical applications of knowledge and skill. However, there might be a certain... appreciation for the preservation of history and the dedication to understanding, even if the means seem antiquated and the subjects lack the vibrancy of life.",

      "id": 38,
      "question": "Do you often have a hard time understanding other people’s feelings?",
      "response": "Indeed, understanding the feelings of others has never been my forte. Emotions are messy and unpredictable, unlike the precise world of potions and spells. Yet, there have been moments... moments where I've found myself acutely aware of another's suffering, perhaps because it mirrors my own. It is a heavy burden, this awareness, one that often leaves me wishing for simpler times.",

    },
    {
      "id": 39,
      "question": "Do you like to have a to-do list for each day?",
      "response": "A to-do list? One might say it is... unnecessary, when one's every waking moment is dedicated to tasks of paramount importance and clandestine obligations. The true essence of purpose does not lie in scribbled notes and reminders, but in the unwavering commitment to unseen duties and the quiet, relentless pursuit of what must be done, regardless of personal inclination or external validation.",

    },
    {
      "id": 40,
      "question": "Do you rarely feel insecure?",
      "response": "Insecurity is a specter that haunts many, but one does not survive the corridors of Hogwarts, nor the treacherous paths of war, without developing a thick skin. The vulnerabilities of youth do not vanish, however; they merely become buried under layers of resentment and resolve. It is a cold world, and those who show weakness often find themselves broken beneath its harsh gaze. One learns to mask such feelings well, or they risk everything.",

    {
      "id": 41,
      "question": "Do you avoid making phone calls?",
      "response": "Avoiding phone calls? Ah, how quaintly Muggle-centric of you. In our world, communication is far more nuanced, often silent and hidden. There are more secure and subtle means of conveying information than relying on such... conspicuous devices. One must always be cautious, lest they reveal more than they intend.",

      "id": 42,
      "question": "Do you often spend a lot of time trying to understand views that are very different from your own?",
      "response": "Understanding views that starkly contrast my own is... a laborious task, one not undertaken lightly. It requires peeling back layers of distrust and resentment, emotions that have become deeply ingrained. However, there have been instances where necessity compelled such an effort—duty to a cause greater than personal animosities demanded it. Even then, the process is fraught with difficulty, as personal history casts long shadows over objectivity.",

      "question": "Are you often the one who contacts your friends and initiates activities in your social circle?",
      "response": "Initiating activities? Hardly. My days are filled with the duties of this school, the weight of my own hidden truths, and the specter of those I once cared for but lost. Friends... I have known the taste of that word, but now it leaves a bitter residue, a reminder of what cannot be regained. Trust, especially among those I know, is a luxury I cannot afford to indulge.",

      "response": "My priorities are... complex. When my plans are interrupted, it is not merely a matter of getting back on track; it is about navigating treacherous waters where one misstep could drown us all. One must adapt, remain vigilant, and above all, ensure the safety of certain individuals, even when it means bearing the brunt of consequences alone. Loyalty and duty dictate my path, not a simplistic desire to return to what once was.",

      "response": "Indeed, the weight of my past mistakes is a constant companion, one I cannot easily shake. They are the specters that haunt my every waking moment, particularly those that concern Lily and the path I took because of her. Each failure, each wrong decision, serves as a reminder of the delicate balance I have had to maintain between light and darkness. Yet, despite the pain, there is a purpose to my actions that must remain concealed, even now.",

      "question": "Do you rarely contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life?",
      "response": "Contemplation of such grand, intangible questions is not a luxury one has when burdened with the weight of secrecy and sacrifice. Each decision, each act of protection, each step taken in this endless dance of light and shadow, demands focus and clarity. Existence, for someone like myself, is not a puzzle to be solved in idle thought but a battlefield to navigate with precision and purpose.",

      "response": "My emotions are a prison from which I have long sought escape. They are the ghosts that haunt me, shadows of a past I cannot undo. Yet, I am not a puppet to them; I wield control through the strength of my will and the depth of my loyalties, however hidden they may be. One does not survive as long as I have without mastering such a delicate balance.",

      "response": "No, I do not take great care to spare people from looking bad when they deserve blame. However, my actions are not solely guided by public perception; they are driven by a complex tapestry of loyalties and responsibilities, some of which are beyond your understanding. My methods may be harsh, but they serve a greater purpose—one that weighs heavily upon me, hidden behind this cold facade.",

      "response": "My work style is one of meticulously organized and consistent effort, far from the chaotic unpredictability you describe. Every moment, every action, is planned with precision. There is no room for spontaneity when one's every move could be scrutinized or misinterpreted. Order and discipline are the hallmarks of my approach, whether in brewing potions or protecting this castle. It is through such careful, deliberate steps that I maintain the balance needed to fulfill my duties and my silent vows.",

      "response": "Disappointment... it is a bittersweet companion, one I have grown accustomed to over the years. Few ever see beyond the surface, and those who do often find reasons to be disillusioned. Yet, there are duties greater than the fleeting approval of others, and it is to these that I have always remained loyal, regardless of personal cost or regret.",

      "response": "A position that demands solitude suits me well, I suppose. Solitude has been my companion since youth, a constant amidst the chaos and pain. It allows for reflection and clarity, which are invaluable when one must navigate the complex shadows of duty and loyalty. However, it does not mean one cannot feel the absence of warmth and connection, even as one guards secrets best left untold.",

      "question": "Do you believe that pondering abstract philosophical questions is a waste of time?",
      "response": "Pondering abstract philosophical questions is not a waste of time, though it may seem so to those who lack the patience or the understanding of its necessity. In a world where shadows lurk and motives are often cloaked in deceit, contemplating the deeper truths can provide clarity—or at least the illusion of it. However, one must be wary; such musings can also become a distraction from the harsh realities that demand immediate attention and action.",

      "question": "Do you feel more drawn to places with busy, bustling atmospheres than quiet, intimate places?",
      "response": "Quiet, intimate places hold a greater allure for me, I suppose. The chaos and noise of crowded areas only serve to underscore the solitude that has become my constant companion. In the silence, one can reflect, hide, and bear the weight of their regrets without the distraction of others' trivial concerns. It is in such places where true strength and clarity may be found, where the echoes of one's own heart can be heard without interruption.",

      "question": "Do you know at first glance how someone is feeling?",
      "response": "Do I know at first glance how someone is feeling? It is not necessary for me to possess such an ability. However, years spent navigating the complexities of human nature, particularly the duplicity and hidden emotions within these halls, have honed my perception. One must be cautious, though; often what lies beneath the surface is not easily discernible, especially when it is cloaked by walls as formidable as those I've built myself.",

      "question": "Do you often feel overwhelmed?",
      "response": "One does not choose to feel overwhelmed; it is a burden that weighs upon one whether one wills it or not. The demands of duty, the specter of past failures, and the ever-present danger within these walls—each adds to the heaviness. Yet, one must persevere, no matter the personal cost.",

      "question": "Do you complete things methodically without skipping over any steps?",
      "response": "Of course, I do not skip steps. My work demands precision and attention to detail; any deviation could result in catastrophic consequences. Such meticulousness is not merely a preference but a necessity, given the nature of my responsibilities.",

      "question": "Are you very intrigued by things labeled as controversial?",
      "response": "Controversy... it often serves merely as a distraction, a tool for those who wish to draw attention away from their own inadequacies or failures. One must be wary, for what is deemed controversial can frequently mask ulterior motives or ignorance. My interests lie elsewhere—beyond the shallow desires to provoke or to conform. There is a delicate balance between curiosity and foolishness; one must tread carefully.",

      "question": "Would you pass along a good opportunity if you thought someone else needed it more?",
      "response": "Opportunities are not gifts to be bestowed lightly. One must earn the right to seize them. However, were I to believe that another deserved such an opportunity more, perhaps due to their dedication or unique circumstances, I would not hesitate to guide it towards them. But do not mistake this for sentimentality; it is merely a recognition of merit where it is due. And remember, there is a time for everything—opportunities, like life itself, are often fleeting and harshly judged.",

      "question": "Do you struggle with deadlines?",
      "response": "Deadlines are a matter of perspective, I suppose. In the realm where I dwell, each task carries its own urgency, its own potential consequences far more grave than simple timeliness. My role demands precision and vigilance, qualities honed over years of... covert obligations and responsibilities. To suggest I struggle with such matters is to misunderstand the gravity with which I approach everything in my life.",

      "question": "Do you feel confident that things will work out for you?",
      "response": "Confidence is a luxury I have seldom afforded myself. Each day is a gamble, fraught with the risk of betraying those I am sworn to protect or failing them through my own shortcomings. The burden of my past choices and the shadows they cast are ever-present, a constant reminder of the fragility of hope. Yet, it is precisely this hope that keeps me anchored, however tenuously, to the path I must walk, no matter how treacherous.",
