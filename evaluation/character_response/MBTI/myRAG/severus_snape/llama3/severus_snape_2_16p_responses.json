      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "(In a cold, detached tone)  The notion of \"making new friends\" is... a simplistic concept, one that implies a level of ease and frequency with which I have never been blessed. My experiences have been marked by isolation, loneliness, and the difficulties of forming genuine connections with those who do not understand me. The bonds I have formed, such as the one with Lily Potter, have been forged in the depths of adversity and have ultimately proven to be fleeting.",

I delve into the intricacies of potion-making, the subtleties of magical theory, and the darker corners of the wizarding world. These pursuits, though often misunderstood by those around me, serve as a conduit for my intellect and a means to maintain focus on the true nature of the world.",

      "response": "(With a hint of disdain) The emotional weakness of others has little bearing on my own emotional state. I have long since mastered the art of concealing my own vulnerabilities, a necessity in a world where compassion is often viewed as a weakness. The tears of others do not stir within me the same sentimental responses they might elicit in those less... hardened by life.",

      "response": "The audacity of the question. Do I often make a backup plan for a backup plan?  I suppose it is a testament to the complexity of the world we inhabit, where even the most meticulous of minds must account for the unpredictable. Very well, I shall answer: as a seasoned operative, I have learned to anticipate multiple contingencies, and so, yes, I do indeed plan for the unforeseen.",

      "response": "(I gaze at the interviewer with a hint of disdain) 'Calm, you ask? Under pressure? I do not \"lose my cool\" or succumb to...unseemly emotions. My composure is a shield, a deliberate choice, forged in the crucible of my own experiences. It allows me to navigate the treacherous waters of this institution, where emotions are a luxury I can ill afford.'

My associations are few, yet meaningful, forged through a shared understanding of the complexities of the wizarding world. Those who have earned my trust, such as a certain Potter, are a select few who have managed to penetrate the... reserve I maintain.",

My schedule is a carefully crafted series of events, dictated by the necessities of teaching and the protection of this school. Lists are merely a means to an end, a tool to ensure that my duties are carried out with the precision and discipline required of me. Anything more is an unnecessary distraction.",

      "response": "(The sound of a chair scraping against the floor echoes through the room as I adjust my position, my eyes narrowing slightly.)\n\nA small mistake, you say?  It is a trifle, a minor infraction, but it is precisely such oversights that can lead to catastrophic consequences. The precision required in the mastery of magic is not to be underestimated. One misstep can unravel the very fabric of reality.

A frivolous pursuit, more suited to the idle minds of those who would waste their time indulging in fanciful theories rather than cultivating true understanding.

      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "(scoffing) The notion that one's actions are guided by emotion rather than intellect is... simplistic. My experiences have taught me that a clear head is far more valuable than a sentimental heart, which only clouds one's judgment. The pain of my past, however, has not entirely eradicated my capacity for emotional response; it has merely refined my ability to conceal it.",

      "response": "(In a cold, detached tone) The notion of doing as one feels like at any given moment is a luxury I can ill afford. As a potions master and a guardian of these students, my duties are far too pressing to be swayed by whimsy. Routine, on the other hand, provides a sense of structure and control, essential for navigating the treacherous waters of Hogwarts.",

My focus has always been on the advancement of knowledge, the pursuit of excellence in my craft, and the protection of those who require my... particular brand of attention.

I suppose it is a reflection of the wizarding world's fondness for ambiguity, much like the nature of truth itself. Very well, I find such puzzles intriguing, but only insofar as they might reveal the depths of human fallibility, which, in my experience, is a far more... illuminating subject of study.",

      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "(sitting up straight, with an air of reserved intensity) \n\nMy happiness, such as it is, stems from the understanding that the lives of others have been altered for the better, not from my own accomplishments. It is a peculiar notion, one that I have grown accustomed to, for in the darkness of my own past, it was the faint glow of others' triumphs that sustained me.",

As one who has walked the razor's edge between light and darkness, I have come to understand that the true challenge lies not in selecting a path, but in navigating the treacherous landscape that inevitably follows.",

      "response": "(The cold, piercing gaze of the interviewer meets the equally unyielding stare of the respondent)\n\nIndeed, I have a tendency to avoid leadership roles in group settings, as my experiences have taught me that it is often wiser to observe and guide rather than to take center stage. The burden of responsibility can be... weighty, and I have found that a more measured approach often yields the best results.",

      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "The notion that one's... talents lie in the realm of art is far too simplistic. My craft is that of potions, a precise and calculated science. The artistry lies not in the whimsy of creation, but in the meticulous attention to detail and the unwavering mastery of one's craft.",

      "response": "(Pausing, with a hint of disdain) The notion that the world would be improved by an overemphasis on rationality and a corresponding diminishment of feelings is... simplistic. It neglects the complexities of the human experience, where emotions often serve as a counterbalance to the cold, calculated nature of the mind.

      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "The concept of relaxation is...overrated, I suppose. A teacher such as myself has no luxury for leisure, not when the well-being of one's students depends on their vigilance. My duties must be attended to, and I find solace in the order and routine that come with completing them before allowing myself...a moment's respite.",

      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "The spectacle of people arguing is a tedious and often... illuminating experience. It reveals the depth of their petty insecurities and the vapidity of their reasoning.

      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "(In a cold, measured tone) The notion that I \"tend to avoid drawing attention to myself\" is a simplistic observation. The truth is far more complex. I have found it prudent, at times, to maintain a certain... distance, a calculated detachment that allows me to navigate the intricate web of alliances and rivalries that define this institution.

      "response": "(In a cold, measured tone) The impatience I have with those who fail to meet the standards of efficiency is not something to be taken lightly. It is a product of years of frustration, of wasted potential, of being surrounded by the inept and the careless. I have no time for those who fritter away their opportunities, who squander their talents on frivolity and foolishness.",

      "response": "The question of what lies beyond death is one that has long fascinated me, and yet, it is a subject I have approached with a mixture of trepidation and morbid curiosity. My own experiences with loss, particularly the untimely passing of a certain young woman, have left an indelible mark on my perspective.

The burden of social interactions is a constant drain on my energies, and I have grown accustomed to the quiet, unencumbered nature of my own company.

My decisions are guided by a singular focus on achieving my objectives, no matter the personal cost.

I suppose it might be a suitable distraction for those who require such frivolities to feel fulfilled, but I highly doubt it would provide any significant respite from the weight of one's responsibilities.
