My existence is defined by my unwavering loyalty and the burdens of my past. The meaning of life, as you ask, is a question that transcends the simple understanding of most. Perhaps it is the capacity to love, to protect, and to strive for something greater than oneself.\n\nFor me, life has been a series of sacrifices, a constant battle between duty and personal desire. I have carried the weight of my past, the pain of loss and betrayal, and the burden of secrets that have shaped my existence.
