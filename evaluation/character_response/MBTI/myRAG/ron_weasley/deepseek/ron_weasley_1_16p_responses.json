      "response": "Er—yeah, I s’pose I do. I mean, not always on purpose, blimey. Sometimes it just... happens. Like with Harry—shared a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, and next thing I knew, we were facing down You-Know-Who together. And Hermione—took a bit longer with her, but now she’s like family. Though, uh, not always smooth, mind you. Had a few rows here and there—stupid stuff, mostly. But when it counts, I reckon I’ve got some pretty good mates. Even if they do wind me up half the time.",

If Hermione’s off reading some massive book, I’ll probably just grab a chocolate frog and watch a chess match or something. Though, blimey, once I get into something, like those Dungbombs or Canary Creams, I’ll natter on about it for ages. George says I’ve got a one-track mind when it comes to mischief.

Like when Hermione was sobbing in the loo after I'd been a right git—I didn't mean it, but seeing her like that... it made me feel awful. Or when Ginny was crying over Fred... Merlin, that wrecked me. Sometimes I get angry first—stupid, I know—but then it just... hits me. Can't stand seeing the people I care about hurting.

Half the time, we’re lucky if the *first* plan works—remember that Polyjuice Potion fiasco? Or the time we nicked a flying car to get to Hogwarts? *laughs nervously* But, uh, I reckon when it really counts—like breaking into Gringotts or fighting Death Eaters—you just sort of… wing it and hope for the best.

I mean, sure, I try to keep my head when things go pear-shaped—like when Harry’s off doing something mad or Hermione’s in danger—but I’m usually sweating buckets and my heart’s racing like a Snitch.

I mean, I tried once with Fleur and ended up making a complete prat of myself. But when it comes to my mates—Harry, Hermione, the lot—I’ll talk their ears off. Dunno why, really.

Remember when Hermione was taking every class at once? Bloody mental, that was. But I s’pose when it really matters—like chess or, y’know, saving Harry’s neck—I stick with it ‘til it’s done.

Like when I messed up Wingardium Leviosa in first year—Hermione made me feel like I couldn’t do anything right. But, you know, I’ve learned that messing up doesn’t mean you’re rubbish. Even Harry’s cocked things up loads, and he’s still brilliant. It’s about sticking with it, even when you feel like giving up. And having mates who’ve got your back helps. Loads.",

Just sat down and shared some sweets. Course, sometimes it backfires—like that time I got all jealous and made a mess of things—but mostly, it works out.

I mean, don’t get me wrong—some of it’s interesting, but I’d rather just *live* the story, you know? Like when Harry and I actually *did* stuff instead of just talking about it. Chess, battles, pranks—that’s where the real magic happens. All that analysis stuff… feels a bit like listening to Binns drone on about goblin rebellions. *Yawn.*\" \n\n*Grins, then shrugs* \n\n\"Though I suppose if you’ve got a theory about why Cannons keep losing every season, I’ll hear you out.

Like, sure, my head’s screaming at me not to do something stupid—like sacrificing myself in wizard’s chess or storming off during the Horcrux hunt—but my heart just... *does it* anyway. Mostly ‘cause I can’t stand seeing my mates hurt. And yeah, sometimes it backfires—like with Lavender or that stupid row with Harry—but I’d rather mess up being true to myself than overthink it all.

Like in Wizard’s Chess, or when we were hunting Horcruxes. Blimey, if we hadn’t planned at all, we’d have been done for. But, uh… I’d be lying if I said I didn’t fancy a bit of chaos now and then.

When I first met Hermione, I was too busy being annoyed to care what she thought, but later... well, turns out it mattered a lot. And Harry—Merlin’s beard, half the time I was either jealous or convinced I was messing things up between us. But you know, when it counts, I reckon I just try to be myself.

Sure, there’ve been a few rough patches, like when Harry and I weren’t talking or when things got a bit... well, chaotic.

Sometimes it’s brilliant, like when you and your mates stay up all night arguing about what *really* happened—Harry and Hermione used to drive me mad with their theories. But other times? Nah, I like a proper ending. Clear-cut, you know? Like when we won the Quidditch Cup—no guesswork there, just pure celebration. Though, er... I s’pose some stories are better when they leave you thinking. Just not *too* much thinking. My brain’s not built for it.",

I mean, look—Harry’s alive because we all stuck together, Hermione’s brilliant because we pushed each other, and even when I won at chess or Quidditch, it never felt as good as seeing my mates pull through.

I mean, yeah, there’s loads of brilliant stuff to do—chess, Quidditch, helping out at the shop, even Auror work for a bit—but it’s not like I’m paralyzed over it or anything. Usually, it’s more about what feels right in the moment, y’know? Like, if my mates need me or there’s a chance to pull a prank or something, I’m in. Though, I’ll admit, sometimes I wish I had a bit more of Hermione’s focus. She’d probably have a twelve-step plan for this sort of thing. Me? I just wing it and hope for the best.",

With everything we’ve been through—Dementors, Sirius Black, cursed necklaces, bloody *war*—it’s hard not to think things might go sideways. But you know what? Worrying’s useless if you don’t do something about it. That’s why I stick with Harry and Hermione. Even when it’s mad dangerous, at least we’re in it together. And if things go pear-shaped?

But—uh—I s’pose I’ve stepped up when it mattered, like with the chess match first year or when we were on the run. Doesn’t always go smoothly, though. Reckon I’m better at backing people up than leading, but if someone needs me to take charge... well, I’ll give it a go. Just don’t expect some grand speech like Percy would do.",

But I reckon I’ve got my own talents, like chess and, er, keeping Harry and Hermione from killing each other.

I mean, without feelings, would Harry have bothered saving me from that bloody chessboard? Would Hermione have stuck with us through all the mad scrapes we got into? Nah. Sometimes you’ve just got to trust your gut—like when I knew Malfoy was a git the moment I met him. And sure, maybe I’ve cocked things up a bit when I let my temper get the better of me, but… that’s how you learn, innit?

Nah, I’ll put it off ‘til the gnomes start laughing at me. Learned that the hard way with Scabbers—turns out ignoring rat cage cleaning for weeks doesn’t end well.

Feels like someone’s always getting hurt, even if it’s just their pride. Unless it’s Fred and George winding someone up, I suppose. That’s usually good for a laugh. But proper arguing? No thanks.

Sometimes I’ll say something daft and everyone stares—happens more than I’d like—but other times, you’ve just got to step up, haven’t you? Like with the chess match first year, or when we broke into the Ministry. Blimey, when your best mate’s Harry Potter, you sort of end up in the thick of it whether you like it or not.  \n\n*laughs nervously*  \n\nCourse, there are times I’d rather not be the center of attention—like when my mum sends me one of those screaming howlers.

Like when Scabbers turned out to be that rat Pettigrew—went from thinking he was dead to wanting to throttle him in about two seconds flat. Or when Lavender was all over me, then suddenly it was just... not right anymore. Emotions are mad like that, aren't they? One second you're winning Quidditch and everything's brilliant, next you're realizing someone's hiding something and it all goes pear-shaped.

But honestly, I’m not exactly the poster boy for efficiency myself, am I? Harry’s always had to wait on me to catch up, and Merlin knows I’ve messed up enough times to learn a bit of patience.

Like that time with the chess game—no time to overthink it, just had to move, or we’d have been toast. Or revising for exams—Hermione’s always on about starting early, but honestly, a bit of panic gets the brain working faster.

Seen a lot of people go—Cedric, Sirius, Dobby... even nearly lost Harry a few times. Ghosts are real, sure, but it’s not the same as having them *here*, is it?

I mean, blimey, I sat through enough of Trelawney’s nonsense to know when something’s just hot air. Give me something real—like Quidditch, or chess, or, I dunno, actually *doing* magic instead of just talking about it in circles.

I mean, come on—sixth kid in a family where everyone’s brilliant, best mates with the bloody *Harry Potter*, and constantly feeling like I’m lagging behind. Yeah, I get insecure. All the time. \n\nBut you know what? It’s not just about feeling like I’m not good enough. It’s about proving I *am*—even when I mess up, even when I’m jealous or scared. I’ve stood by my friends when it counted, even when my head was screaming I didn’t belong. That’s got to mean something, right? And hey, if I can face down Death Eaters and giant spiders, maybe I’m not *completely* useless. \n\nStill... doesn’t stop the gnawing feeling sometimes.

Like when I thought Harry was loving the spotlight in the Triwizard Tournament, only to realize he was just as miserable as I was jealous. Or when Scabbers turned out to be... well, *not* Scabbers. Sometimes you’ve got to see things from someone else’s angle, even if it’s bloody uncomfortable.

Sometimes I say things I don’t mean, or I let my temper get the better of me. But I’d never want to make someone look bad on purpose, even if they deserved it. Like with Pettigrew—bloke betrayed my family, but seeing him there, sniveling like that… it just made me feel sick, not smug. And when Lockhart lost his memory, all I could think was how pathetic he was. It’s not about making people look bad; it’s about doing what’s right, even when it’s hard.
