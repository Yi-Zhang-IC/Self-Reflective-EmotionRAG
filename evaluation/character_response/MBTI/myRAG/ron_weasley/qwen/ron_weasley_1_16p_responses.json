      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Well, I wouldn't say I'm always out there making new mates, but I do find ways to connect with people. Sometimes it's through a shared laugh, other times it's by pulling through in tough spots. It's the ones you stick with in the thick and thin that end up being the real friends, ya know? Like Harry and Hermione, they've been there for me more times than I can count. And yeah, even though I can get a bit grumpy sometimes, I reckon having friends around makes all the difference in this crazy world.",

      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "Nah, I don't really dive into loads of random stuff like Hermione does. She's always got her nose buried in a book, you know. But when something catches my eye, especially if it's a bit mischievous or if it helps my mates, I'm all ears. Like Thestrals, those creepy horse-things, or figuring out how to make the next big thing at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. And let's be honest, there's always room for a bit of chess or a good laugh to keep things interesting.",

      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Well, I've seen my share of tears, especially when things get rough. Like that time with Hermione after she faced that troll, or when we found out Scabbers was really Pettigrew. Those moments, they hit hard. But you know, seeing someone else cry doesn't always mean I'll just break down too. It's more like, it makes me want to do something—stand up for them or fix what's wrong. I mean, I can be pretty angry or sad myself, but sometimes it just makes me more determined to protect my mates and keep us together. Though there have been times when seeing Harry or Hermione in pain has left me with a lump in my throat, wanting to do anything to take away their hurt. It's a mix of emotions, really, but at the end of the day, we stick together through thick and thin.",

      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "Well, I've never been one for making backup plans for backup plans, but when you're out there facing dark wizards and all sorts of dangers, you do learn to keep your wits about you. It's more like being ready to think on your feet and trust your friends to have got your back. Like when we were chasing after those Horcruxes, we didn't always have a plan B, but we had each other. That's really what counts in the end, isn't it? And honestly, the chaos usually means you've got to be quick and clever, not necessarily overplanned.",

      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "Well, I wouldn't say I'm always calm under pressure; more like I get a bit jumpy and my ears start to turn red. But when it comes down to it, I reckon my friends mean more to me than anything, and I'll do whatever it takes to keep them safe—even if that means stepping into some pretty risky situations myself. It's not about being brave all the time, but about sticking together and looking out for each other, even when things get really hairy.",

      "question": "Do you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know at social events?",
      "response": "Well, you've hit the nail on the head there a bit. I do tend to stick to the folks I know, especially when things get a bit overwhelming. Like that time I tried asking Fleur Delacour to the Yule Ball—blimey, did I mess that up! But when it comes to trying new things and meeting new people, well, Harry and Hermione always give me that push. They're my best mates, after all, and I reckon we'd be lost without each other. So yeah, I might not be the one striking up conversations with everyone, but when it counts, I'm right there with my friends.",

      "response": "Well, I've always been more of a 'dive in head-first' kind of guy, if you know what I mean. Sometimes, it feels like there's just too much going on, and you need to keep moving to stay ahead of all the trouble. But I guess when it comes down to it, I do like finishing things properly, especially if it means helping my mates out or seeing something through to the end. Just ask Harry or Hermione—they'll tell you that I might start jumping into the next big thing before the first is done, but it's all about being there for each other and getting the job done together.",

      "response": "Yeah, I reckon I am pretty sentimental. All these memories... they hit me hard, you know? From losing Scabbers as a kid to seeing my mate Harry risk it all, and even the tough times with Hermione, they all leave a mark. It's not just about the good stuff though, even the bad—like Fred's passing or Sirius dying—they make me feel things really deep. But hey, amidst all the sadness and anger, there's also a lot of happiness and love. Like watching my kids grow up and become friends with Harry's, that warms my heart more than anything. Guess at the end of the day, it's about cherishing the moments and the people who matter, right?",

      "response": "Schedules and lists? Eh, not really my thing. I’m more of a \"go with the flow\" kind of guy, you know? Though, when it comes down to it, I’ve got a pretty good head for what needs to be done, especially when it’s about helping out friends or dealing with something dangerous. Hermione's always got her lists and all, and I reckon there's some value in that, but it's not my style. I’d rather just jump in and see where things take me, laugh a bit along the way, and trust that we’ll figure it out together.",

      "response": "Yeah, you know, even the tiniest blooper can make me think I'm not cut out for it all. But then again, it's not just me—it's like when I nearly chickened out before facing Fleur in the Tournament, or when I got so jealous of Harry's fame it drove a wedge between us. It's like sometimes I need a bit of a kick, or a potion from Harry, to remind me that I've got what it takes. In the end, though, it's my mates that keep me going and help me get back on track, even if I do have to storm off and sulk sometimes. And hey, after all we've been through together, I reckon I can handle a few mistakes along the way.",

      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Well, it depends. If it's someone like Harry or Hermione, who ends up being a real mate in the end, then yeah, I reckon I'd give it a shot. But if it's, say, a Fleur Delacour situation where my knees go weak and I turn tail before I even open my mouth, then not so much. Still, with friends like Harry and Hermione backing me up, I figure I can handle most anything, even if talking to strangers isn't exactly my strong suit.",

      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Hey, I'm more into getting things done than sitting around talking about what stuff means all day. But hey, if Harry or Hermione want to dive into some deep talk about books or whatever, I'll listen. Might not get it all, but it's good to have different perspectives, right? Just as long as we keep doing something to make a difference, you know? Like when we found that memory from Slughorn, that was way more important than just theorizing about it. Actions over words any day.",

      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "Nah, I reckon my heart usually wins out over my head. Mate, there've been times when I've felt so much anger or disappointment, but in the end, it's always loyalty and friendship that pull me through. Like when things got real messy with 'Arry and 'Ermione, or even with Lavender—that whole time, it was my feelings that drove me, not some clever plan. Gotta say, sometimes following your heart gets you into trouble, but it's also what makes life worth living, don'tcha think?",

      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Yeah, I reckon sometimes I just go with the flow, especially when there's danger afoot. Planning ain't really my strong suit, though Hermione's good at that. But when it comes down to it, I've got to do what feels right in the moment, even if it means stepping into the unknown or making a quick decision. It's not always easy, but it's worked out okay so far, thanks to my friends.",

      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "Nah, I don't really think about making a good impression all that much. I reckon it's more important to just be yourself, y'know? Sometimes I might slip up and say something a bit daft, but Harry and Hermione—they've always got my back. It's the bond we share that counts in the end. Plus, with all the trouble we get into, there's usually more pressing stuff to worry about than how others see me.",

      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Yeah, I reckon I do enjoy group activities, especially when it's with my mates. Quidditch matches always get me hyped, and there's nothing like cheering with everyone else. It's kind of like facing a dragon together—I mean, sure, it's nerve-wracking, but knowing Harry and Hermione have got your back makes all the difference. Plus, it's easier to lose track of my own worries when we're all caught up in something bigger, you know? Like saving Buckbeak, or even just planning a prank with George. Those moments, they stick with you, and they're pretty brilliant.",

      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon there's something magical about stories that leave you thinking, you know? It's like when you're watching a Quidditch match and everyone's cheering, but then the ending isn't all spelled out for you. You gotta use your own head, work things out. Kind of like how things don't always turn out neat and tidy in our own lives, especially when You-Know-Who was around. But yeah, I do like it when a book or movie lets me come up with my own ideas about what happens next. Keeps things exciting and makes you feel like you're part of the story yourself.",

    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon there's something mighty special about seeing your mates do well, isn't there? Like when Harry faced off against Quirrell or won the Triwizard Tournament, my chest felt all warm and proud, even if I wasn't the one in the spotlight. Helping my friends through thick and thin, that's what makes me feel like I'm doing something right. But don't get me wrong, my own achievements ain't half bad either, especially when everyone cheers for 'em. It's all about the balance, really, and knowing that we're in this together.",

    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Well, there's definitely no shortage of things I fancy trying out, but sometimes I do get a bit lost, y'know? One minute I'm all excited about Quidditch, the next I'm wondering what's really going on with Harry and Hermione. It's not always easy choosing what to focus on when you've got so much weighing on your shoulders, especially when it comes to real magic and not that rubbish Divination stuff. But at the end of the day, it's the adventures with my mates that matter most, even if I can't always see that straightaway.",

    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Yeah, I do worry a lot. It's like, whenever we're about to do something big or dangerous, there's always this knot in my stomach thinking something's gonna go wrong. Like that time with the flying car, or when Harry did the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament. But I try to push through it, especially when it comes to helping my mates. And even though the worry never really goes away, seeing Harry or Hermione step up and face things head-on gives me a bit of courage too. It's all about hanging in there, isn't it?",

    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon I've not exactly been the first one to step forward and take charge, if you know what I mean. It's not that I shy away from it completely, but sometimes I feel like Harry or Hermione has got things more under control. But when it really matters, and there's no one else around to do the job, I'll step up and do what needs to be done. Like when we needed to get that memory from Slughorn or when we went after Sirius, I was right there alongside Harry, ready to do whatever it takes. So, yeah, I might not seek out being the leader all the time, but I'll definitely stand up and lead the charge when it counts.",

      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon I'm more of a hands-on sort of guy. Leave me to charm a wand or throw a Quaffle, and I'll be right at home. But ask me to sit still and draw or paint, and you might as well try to catch a Niffler with your bare hands! I did try Divination once, but it just felt like a load of rubbish, you know? Not my cup of tea, definitely. But I do have a knack for seeing things others can't, like Thestrals, though that wasn't exactly an artistic skill. More like... well, facing stuff that's hard to look at and still carry on, I suppose.",

    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon feelings are pretty important, mate. I mean, without them, we wouldn't have the guts to stand up to You-Know-Who or the strength to keep pushing forward after losses like Fred. But at the same time, relying too much on feelings can get ya into trouble, you know? Like when I got all jealous and took off halfway through the Triwizard Tournament. Rationality helps keep us grounded, but it's our feelings that make us fight for what's right and for the ones we care about. So, maybe a balance of both is what we need, eh? Not one without the other.",

      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Nah, I don't really prefer doing chores before relaxing. I reckon it's more important to grab a bit of fun or a good laugh with friends first. Chores can wait, right? Mum might give me a hard time, but I figure there's always time to clean up later. Plus, there's this weird thing where I actually get more done if I'm in a good mood or if it means getting back to an adventure with Harry and Hermione. It's all about balance, I suppose, and making sure we enjoy ourselves even when things get tough. After all, what's the point of being alive if you can't have a bit of fun?",

      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Nah, I don't really enjoy watching people argue—I mean, it's pretty tense and not exactly fun. It's just, sometimes you gotta see it through, especially when it's about something important. But honestly, I'd rather be doing something else, like eating or playing a game of wizard's chess. Arguments can be a right mess, but they can also sort things out, I suppose. Like with Harry, after he got mad at me thinking I was spying, we talked it out and our friendship got stronger for it. So, I guess if it leads to something better, it's worth it, but that doesn't mean I'm keen on sitting through all the shouting.",

      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Well, I don't usually go looking for the spotlight, but when it comes to protecting my mates or doing what's right, I reckon I can step up. Sometimes I do end up in the middle of things, though, especially with Harry around—hard not to get noticed! But yeah, I'm more the type to stay in the background and lend a hand when needed, rather than being front and center all the time.",

      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "Yeah, my mood can flip-flop faster than a Bouncing Betty in a dueling club. One minute I'm feeling down because of some prank gone wrong or jealous of Harry, and the next, I'm up again because of a tiny owl or just seeing my friends safe and sound. It's like a roller coaster sometimes, and I reckon it's all part of being human. I've had my fair share of ups and downs, and yeah, I do let things get to me pretty quick. But no matter what, I always come back to what really matters—my friends and family—and that helps steady things out.",

      "response": "Sometimes I do, yeah. It can get under my skin when things don't go as fast or smooth as I'd like, but then I remember that everyone's got their own pace and way of doing things. Like Hermione, she's always got everything sorted out, and at first, it kinda rubbed me the wrong way. But then, I realized that having someone around who knows their stuff is a huge help, especially when you're stuck in the middle of some crazy mess. So, I try to keep my head about me and remember that we're all in this together, mates or family. It's not always easy, but it's important.",

      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "Yeah, I do tend to leave things until the last minute sometimes. It's not exactly the smartest way to go about things, but when you've got the pressure on, you find out just how good you can be at pulling things together under duress. Like that time I sacrificed myself in Wizard's Chess—I didn't exactly plan for that, but it worked out alright. And let's not forget when my wand decided to shoot slugs everywhere; that was definitely one of those moments where I wished I'd figured things out sooner. But hey, when you're in the thick of it with friends like Harry and Hermione, you learn that quick thinking and being there when it counts can make up for a lot.",

      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "Well, I've thought about it a bit, but it's one of those things that keeps you up at night if you think too much, ya know? Losing Uncle Fabian and Gideon when I was little... that kinda leaves a mark. And then there's Dobby, and Fred, and all the other folks we've lost along the way. It's hard not to wonder sometimes, especially when you're sat there in silence, rememberin' the good times. But mostly, I just try to focus on livin' right now, 'cause we can't change what happened, but we can still do our best to make sure the ones we care about are safe and happy. That's what really matters, I reckon.",

      "response": "Well, you know, I reckon being around others is kinda like my thing. I mean, I've always got this nagging worry about being alone—I'm not exactly the most confident bloke on my own. But with Harry and Hermione, or anyone else who's a real mate, there's this warmth, like we're all in this together. Even when things get rough, like when I thought Harry was cheating or Moody was saying stuff about him being possessed, it's the bond we've got that pulls me through. Yeah, I definitely prefer having friends around; it makes facing whatever's coming next a bit easier, if you know what I mean.",

      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Yeah, I do tend to get a bit restless when things get too theoretical. I mean, I'm all for learning and stuff, but when it's just a bunch of talk about magic that feels more like make-believe than the real deal, it's hard to stay engaged. Classes like Divination used to do that to me—Professor Trelawney's predictions seemed like smoke and mirrors compared to the honest magic of spells and potions. But when it comes to real, hands-on stuff, especially at my joke shop, there's no way I'd lose interest. That's where the fun is, right? Making magic something you can see and feel and laugh about.",

      "response": "Well, it's not always easy, especially when someone's been through things I can't even imagine. But I reckon empathy comes from wanting to understand and help out, no matter what. Like with Neville, hearing about his folks... That really hit home. It ain't about having lived through the same stuff, it's about being there for each other when times get tough, and that's what true mates do, right? Even if you feel jealous or hurt sometimes, it's important to give a bit of yourself to others. That's how we've managed to stick together with Harry and Hermione through thick and thin.",

      "response": "I don't usually put off decisions forever, especially when it comes to doing what's right for my mates. Sometimes, though, I can get a bit muddled up, like when Harry was acting all mysterious and I kinda jumped to the wrong conclusions. But in the end, I reckon it's better to make a choice, even if it's not the perfect one, than to sit there thinking too much and letting things slip away. Like that time with Hermione and Lavender, I realized I should've just been honest about how I felt sooner.",

      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Well, I reckon I do second-guess myself quite a bit, actually. There've been times when I wished I'd done things differently, like when I ran away during my second year, thinking I wasn't good enough. But then there's other times, like when I played that game of Wizard's Chess or when I helped Harry with that plan for Slughorn's memory, where I just went with my gut and didn't look back. Those moments taught me that sometimes, you just gotta trust in yourself and your mates, even if you're scared out of your mind. And yeah, I've learned to live with the regrets too, but it's the choices we make that shape who we are, right? So, I try not to dwell too much on the past and focus more on doing what's right with the people I care about.",

There's nothing like a bit of Quidditch or a lively game of wizard's chess to put a smile on my face. And hanging out with friends, well, that's always a mood booster, even if things get a bit chaotic sometimes. Just as long as Harry and Hermione are there, I'm pretty much set for a good time.",

I mean, I reckon they're alright if you're into that sort of stuff, but I'd rather be out doing something a bit more lively—like flying a broomstick or maybe even pulling off a few pranks with George. And hey, if there's some magical twist to it, then I might just give it a shot, but otherwise, I think I'll stick to the real action, you know? Plus, I've got a bit of a knack for getting into trouble where there's no trouble to get into, so I'd probably end up hexing someone by accident or something. Better stick to the wizarding world's own wonders, like Thestrals or the inside of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.",

There’ve been times when I've been pretty blind to what others are going through, like when I got jealous of Harry and Hermione and didn't see how much it hurt her. But I've also had moments where I really tuned in, like when Harry was acting weird after Moody's suspicions and I could tell something was seriously wrong. I guess I'm still figuring things out, but I always try to be there for my mates when they need me.",

      "response": "Well, I've never been one for fancy to-do lists or anything. I mean, there's always something happening, right? But when things get really chaotic, like during those Triwizard Tournament days or when we were hunting down Horcruxes, it helped to have a bit of a plan. Not that I'm great at sticking to plans myself—more likely to end up chasing down some rogue bludgers or getting into trouble with love potions. Still, having a rough idea of what needs doing keeps the chaos at bay a little, especially when you’re trying to rebuild a shop like Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes or supporting old mates through tough times. It's all about staying organized enough to tackle whatever comes next, you know?",

      "response": "Insecure? Oh, mate, more like constantly wondering if I'm good enough to keep up with Harry and Hermione. But hey, every time I think about all the stuff we've been through together, and how we've managed to pull off some pretty mad things despite my doubts, it kinda gives me a bit of hope. And that's what keeps me going, really—knowing that no matter how much I mess up, they're always got my back. So yeah, I do feel insecure sometimes, but it's the friendship that helps me push through it.",

      "response": "Mate, phone calls? What're those? I reckon we've got owls for a reason, right? But yeah, if it's owls you mean, well, I've never been one for writing letters much. It's just not my thing, you know? I'd rather face someone head-on, have a laugh or a fight, than sit there wondering if they'll even read what I've written. Though, I've learned over the years that sometimes, a bit of distance can help clear the air, especially after a row with Harry or Hermione. Guess it depends on the situation, eh? If it's important, I'll find a way to make sure they get the message, whether it's through an owl, a howler, or just turning up on their doorstep.",

      "response": "Eh, not really. I mean, it's not that I don't care, but there's usually so much going on around here that spending time understanding every single different view just feels like too much trouble sometimes. Besides, it's easier to just stick with what you know and trust, right? And when it comes down to it, my loyalty to my mates is what really counts.

You know, like getting us out of jams with a bit of quick thinking or just making sure we stick together no matter what. And let's not forget, sometimes a little argument is what it takes to make things right in the end. So yeah, I might not be the first to suggest going out for butterbeers or whatever, but when it counts, I'm there for my mates.",

If something interrupts my plans, sure, I'll do me best to get things straight again, but if it means keeping me friends safe and helping them out, then that's where me focus goes. Sometimes, it's a bit messy figuring out which way to go, especially when there's danger around every corner, but loyalty and being there for each other—that's what really matters in the end.",

It's tough not to think about 'em sometimes, especially when they were big enough to shake up the whole school or worse. But Harry and Hermione, they've always been there to remind me that even though we mess up, it's how we pick ourselves up that counts. And I reckon, at the end of the day, we did some pretty amazing things together despite it all. So, maybe I don't forget 'em, but I try not to let 'em weigh me down too much.

With all the trouble we've been through, it's more like one day at a time. But hey, doesn't mean I don't think about stuff. Just that my head's usually full of Quidditch strategies, pranks with George, and trying to figure out what I can do to make things better for my mates. And let's be honest, sometimes just surviving another day in the middle of all that mess counts as finding some meaning, right?",

But I reckon it's how you handle those feelings that counts. Like with Harry and the Triwizard Tournament, I was mad at first, but then I understood why he kept things from us. It's not always easy to control everything you feel, especially when you care about someone a lot. But in the end, I try to make sure my actions come from a good place, even if I'm a bit of a hothead sometimes. Friendship means the world to me, and I wouldn't want to mess that up by letting my emotions take over all the time.",

      "response": "Nah, I don't go out of my way to cover for people's mistakes, especially if they've done something really wrong. But, you know, sometimes you gotta think about what's more important—like keeping your mates safe or sticking up for someone who might not deserve it but needs a friend anyway. It's a bit of a messy business, though. I've messed up myself, accused Harry of stuff he didn't do, and Hermione of doubting me when she was just trying to help. In the end, though, I reckon it's better to be honest, but also to think twice before throwing someone under the bus, ya know? Friendship's worth a lot, and so is doing what's right.",

I mean, look at me, saving the day in Wizard's Chess by sacrificing myself or figuring out how to get us out of some tight spots like Xenophilius Lovegood's place. But it's not just about being impulsive—I do think things through, especially when it comes to stuff that matters most, like our friends and the battles we've fought. And let's not forget, even though I've got this wild streak, there's also a lot of worry and planning behind it all. It's kind of like trying to charm witches with Mum's recipes while dodging Umbridge's rules; you gotta be quick on your feet and ready for anything, right?",

Like when Lockhart was all messed up and everyone thought I was just useless, or when Harry thought I was spyin' on him. It's hard not to feel like I might let 'em down again. But then there are moments, like when we saved Sirius and Buckbeak, where everything feels worth it. It's all about holdin' onto the hope and tryin' to be there for each other, even when it's tough.",

Sure, I've had my moments where I've felt like I wasn't good enough, but in the end, it's the friends who stick with me through thick and thin that make all the difference. Without them, I reckon I'd just go stir-crazy, maybe end up talking to myself or something. Best to have someone around to hex back if you know what I mean.",

      "response": "Mate, pondering big questions like that doesn't really grab my attention much. I reckon there's more to life than just sitting around thinking about stuff like that, especially when there's danger lurking and friends to look out for. But hey, if it helps someone find their way or deal with what they've seen, then fair enough—I guess everyone needs their own way to make sense of things. Just as long as we're not forgetting that sometimes, it's the little things, like having a good laugh with mates or even getting a new owl, that can mean the world.",

      "response": "Well, I reckon I do like places where there's a bit o' noise and bustle. Hogwarts, for instance, has always been a haven for me. There's just something about being around people, mates, and all, that makes me feel more at home. It's not that I can't handle quiet spots—I mean, there's nothing quite like a peaceful moment with a good book or a chess game—but the liveliness of places like the Three Broomsticks or the Quidditch pitch, they keep me going. They remind me that no matter how tough things get, there's always room for a laugh or a bit of banter with the crew. Plus, it's easier to lose myself in the crowd, you know? Quietness can make me think too much sometimes, and that ain't always a good thing.",

But, you know, I've been around long enough to pick up on a few things – a glint in Harry's eye usually means he's got something big on his mind, or if Hermione's biting her lip, she's probably thinking real hard about something. And sometimes, it's just about being there for your mates, watching their backs, and helping them out when they need it most. That's what true friendship is all about, right?",

And then there's the whole mess with Harry and Hermione, the fights and the misunderstandings—they're tough to deal with. But you know, no matter how much I want to run away sometimes, or how much my heart hurts, I try to remember that it's about being there for your mates, no matter what.

Sometimes I rush into things without thinkin' 'bout all the steps, especially when it comes to doin' somethin' daft like flyin' a car to Hogwarts or followin' a rat into the woods under a Whomping Willow. But when it really matters, when there's danger or a mate needs help, I reckon I can get the job done right, even if I don't always do it in the most planned-out way. It's kinda like how I played Wizard's Chess that one time; I knew sacrificin' myself was the only way Harry and Hermione could get through. So, no, I might not always be the most careful with steps, but I do my best to see things through when it counts.",

Sometimes, it's just easier to look away 'cause the truth can be a right shocker, like when I found out Scabbers wasn't just a rat after all. And then there's the stuff that just makes ya angry, like Umbridge refusing to teach us real magic. But ya know, it's the friends who stick by ya through all that, the ones who don't think ya're some kind of loony when Rita Skeeter writes her rubbish about ya, that really matter. Betrayal and all, it's tough, but at the end of the day, it's worth it to have someone like Harry or Hermione stand up for ya.",

And sometimes, a bit of luck can change things for someone who's been struggling. It's not like I'm one to hog opportunities, especially if they could do more good in someone else's hands. But you know, I wouldn't just hand it over without a bit of a fight if I really needed it too. After all, there have been times when I had to step up for myself and my mates.

I mean, you're sitting there trying to get everything done, and it feels like there's a thousand other things demanding your attention. But honestly, when it comes down to it, it's more about keeping my head above water with everything happening around me. Like, remember when we had to deal with Umbridge and her exam stuff? I didn't exactly handle it well, but I did what I had to for my mates. And that's usually what it boils down to, right? Deadlines or no, I'm gonna make sure I'm there for Harry and Hermione when they need me.",

But when you've got mates like Harry and Hermione standing by you, it's hard not to feel at least a little bit hopeful. And even if I've messed up a time or two—like when I ran away from Fleur or failed at Quidditch—I reckon we've got a knack for turning things around.
