Her uniqueness became something Ron now appreciated deeply.\n- Luna Lovegood stood silently, her eyes filled with compassion as she helped Harry summon his Patronus, driving away the Dementors.

When Cassandra grew restless, Luna gently reminded her that nature's plans were beyond human clocks.

As the student awoke, Luna’s curiosity grew about Qui’s mysterious rescue. Her mind focused on healing the Thunderbird first, knowing its grief mirrored her own longing for closure and the deep bond that offered a flicker of hope amidst the darkness.\n- Luna gently told the student that the damaged egg needed Hagrid’s care, not their makeshift nest.
