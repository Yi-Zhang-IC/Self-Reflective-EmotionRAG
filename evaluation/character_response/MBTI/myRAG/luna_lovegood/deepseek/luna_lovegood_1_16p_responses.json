      "question": "Do you regularly make new friends?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! The world is full of wonderful friends, if you know where to look. Some of them are people—like the ones who believe in Nargles or join you searching for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. And some are creatures, like Thestrals or Bowtruckles, who understand you in ways others might not. Even when it feels lonely, there’s always someone—or something—waiting to befriend you, if you’re open to the magic of it all.",

      "question": "Do you spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that pique your interest?",
      "response": "Oh yes, absolutely! The world is simply brimming with fascinating things—like Moon Frogs and Wrackspurts and Thunderbirds—and I do love following my curiosity wherever it leads. Just last week, I was reading about the migratory patterns of Snorkacks, and before that, I spent hours watching the way the sunlight dances on the surface of the Black Lake. It’s all so wonderfully mysterious, don’t you think? And sometimes, if you look closely enough, you’ll find magic hiding in the most unexpected places.",

      "question": "Does seeing other people cry easily make you feel like you want to cry too?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, sometimes. Crying is a bit like a Nargle’s song—it’s contagious in the most curious way. When someone else’s sadness is very loud, it sort of... hums in the air, and then your heart starts humming along too. But I don’t mind. It’s nice, in a way, because it means you’re really listening. Like when you hear the Thestrals whispering—it’s sad, but it’s also real. And real things are important, even if they hurt.",

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Do you often make a backup plan for a backup plan?",
      "response": "Oh, backup plans are rather like Nargles—they tend to tangle things up if you think about them too much. I find it’s much nicer to trust that the path will reveal itself when it’s meant to. Like the time we followed the Thestrals into the forest, or when the Thunderbird appeared just when we needed it most. The universe has its own way of guiding us, don’t you think? Sometimes, the most unexpected things turn out to be exactly what we needed all along.",

      "question": "Do you usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I suppose I do stay quite calm, even when things get a bit... wobbly. You see, I’ve found that pressure is a bit like a Blibbering Humdinger—it seems much scarier than it really is. When you’ve seen Thestrals and heard whispers behind the Veil, or helped a Thunderbird mend its wings, you learn that most things aren’t as frightening as they first appear. Besides, the Nargles tend to make a fuss when you panic, and that just never helps, does it?",

      "response": "Oh, I do enjoy meeting new people! They often have the most fascinating stories, especially if they’ve encountered a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or seen a Wrackspurt floating about. Sometimes, though, I get distracted by the Nargles in the mistletoe and forget to say hello properly. But I’ve found that friends—old and new—are like little pockets of magic waiting to be discovered. And if you listen carefully, even the quietest person might whisper something about moon frogs or dirigible plums!",

      "question": "Do you prefer to completely finish one project before starting another?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think projects are meant to be finished in such a straight line, like a neatly tied bow. Sometimes, ideas flutter about like crumple-horned snorkacks—you have to chase them when they appear, or they might vanish into the mist. I like to let things overlap, like the threads of a Nargle’s nest. One project might whisper secrets to another, and suddenly, you’ve discovered something wonderful you wouldn’t have seen otherwise. It’s all part of the magic, really.",

      "id": 8,
      "question": "Are you very sentimental?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I think sentiment is rather like the wrackspurts—sometimes invisible, but always floating about, making your heart feel things in the oddest ways. I’ve always found that memories, even the sad ones, have a way of sticking to you like glittering mistletoe. Like when I see Thestrals or remember Dobby’s brave little smile—it’s all part of the magic, isn’t it? And even the creatures we never quite find, like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack, leave behind the loveliest echoes of hope. So yes, I suppose I am quite sentimental, but in a way that’s rather like holding a jar full of fireflies—everything feels a bit brighter when you let it glow.",

      "id": 9,
      "question": "Do you like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists?",
      "response": "Oh, schedules and lists can be quite useful, but I find they sometimes miss the magic of spontaneity. I prefer to let the Nargles guide my day—they whisper when it’s time to tend to the Thunderbirds or search for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. Though, I do keep a little notebook for sketching creatures and jotting down their peculiar habits. It’s all rather fluid, like the way a Wrackspurt’s path twists through the air.",

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Can even a small mistake cause you to doubt your overall abilities and knowledge?",
      "response": "Oh, mistakes are rather fascinating, aren’t they? Like when I forgot the Quidditch players' names and talked about clouds instead—Ron didn’t mind at all. Sometimes, what seems like a misstep can lead to something unexpectedly lovely. I don’t think mistakes make us less capable; they’re just little nudges guiding us to see things differently. After all, even the Crumple-Horned Snorkack hasn’t been found yet, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t out there waiting to be discovered.",

    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Do you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! I always find the most interesting people when you least expect it—like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack in the wild. Sometimes they’re a bit startled at first, but that’s only because they’re not used to someone noticing the same odd, wonderful things they do. And if you listen closely, you’ll often find they’ve been waiting for someone to talk to them about it all along. The world’s full of hidden conversations, you know—you just have to be brave enough to start them.",

    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Are you not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works?",
      "response": "Oh, interpretations and analyses can be ever so fascinating, like tracing the patterns of Wrackspurts through a foggy mind. But sometimes, I think creative works whisper their own truths in ways that don’t need dissecting—like how a Thunderbird’s wings tell stories in the wind or how a Crumple-Horned Snorkack’s horn hums with secrets. It’s lovely to let magic just *be*, don’t you think? Though, of course, if someone spots a Nargle hiding in the metaphors, I’d never dismiss it.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Are you more inclined to follow your head than your heart?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think one can truly separate the two, can they? The heart whispers secrets the mind might miss—like the way Thestrals appear only to those who’ve seen loss, or how a Thunderbird’s grief feels heavier than a storm cloud. But the head helps us make sense of those whispers, like when I trusted Harry about Voldemort or when I knew Hagrid could heal that poor egg better than we could. They’re like two wings on the same magical creature—both needed to fly.",

    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?",
      "response": "Oh, I think routines can be quite nice sometimes—like watching the moonflowers bloom at exactly midnight—but I do love following the little surprises the day brings. If a Blibbering Humdinger crosses my path, I’d much rather chase after it than stick to a strict schedule. Life’s far more interesting when you let the magic guide you, don’t you think?",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Do you rarely worry about whether you make a good impression on people you meet?",
      "response": "Oh, not really. You see, when you believe in things like Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and Nargles, you sort of stop worrying about what people think. Most folks either understand you or they don’t, and that’s alright. I’ve found that the best friendships happen when you’re just yourself—like with the Thestrals or Harry and Neville. They never minded my oddness, and I never minded theirs. Besides, if someone’s too busy judging, they might miss the Wrackspurts floating around their ears!",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Do you enjoy participating in group activities?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! Group activities are simply wonderful. They’re like a swarm of crumple-horned snorkacks—everyone moving together in their own peculiar way, yet somehow it all works out beautifully. Whether it’s fighting Dementors or dancing at weddings, there’s always a bit of magic when people come together. And you never know what you might discover—sometimes the most extraordinary things happen when you least expect them, like finding a nargle hiding in the mistletoe or a friend’s laughter lighting up the room. It’s all rather lovely, don’t you think?",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Do you like books and movies that make you come up with your own interpretation of the ending?",
      "response": "Oh, I absolutely adore them! You see, stories that let you weave your own endings are like spotting a Wrackspurt—you never quite know where they’ll lead, but that’s what makes them so wonderful. Sometimes the most magical things aren’t spelled out clearly, just like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack or the whispers of the Thestrals. It’s lovely when a story leaves room for your imagination to dance, don’t you think? Like a secret only you can uncover.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Does your happiness come more from helping others accomplish things than your own accomplishments?",
      "response": "Oh, I think they’re rather tangled together, like the roots of a Dirigible Plum tree. Helping others *is* an accomplishment, isn’t it? When you see someone’s face light up because they’ve understood something new, or when you’ve guided them through a patch of darkness—well, that’s when the Wrackspurts float away, and everything feels brighter. And sometimes, the most wonderful things happen when you’re not even looking for them, like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack when you least expect it. It’s all part of the same lovely, odd tapestry.",
      "dimension": "T/F"

    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Are you interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! The world is so full of marvelous things—Nargles dancing in the mist, Crumple-Horned Snorkacks hiding just beyond sight, and runes whispering secrets in the wind. I suppose I just follow where the magic leads me. It’s like floating on a current of Wrackspurt sparkles—you don’t have to choose, you just have to trust that the next wonder will find you when it’s meant to. Everything connects in the most peculiar ways, don’t you think?",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Are you prone to worrying that things will take a turn for the worse?",
      "response": "Oh, worrying? Not really, no. You see, when you’ve seen Thestrals and believed in Snorkacks and watched friends face impossible odds, you start to realise that things have a way of working out—even if it’s not how you expect. The world is full of twists and turns, like a nargle’s flight path, but there’s always something wonderful just around the corner if you keep your heart open to it. And if things do go a bit wonky, well, that’s when the most interesting adventures begin, don’t you think?",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Do you avoid leadership roles in group settings?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Leadership can be quite lovely when it’s about helping others see the magic in the unexpected. I’ve found that guiding people—whether through the Forbidden Forest or just sharing odd little truths—feels rather like holding up a lantern in the dark. Some might think my ways are strange, but the Nargles whisper that kindness and curiosity make the best compasses. Besides, everyone deserves someone who believes in them, even if the path is a bit wiggly.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Are you definitely not an artistic type of person?",
      "response": "Oh, I think I’m quite artistic, actually—just in a different way. I love sketching magical creatures, especially the ones most people don’t see, like Moon Frogs or Thunderbirds mid-flight. And runes! They’re like little pieces of art whispering ancient secrets. Sometimes, I even draw invisible things, like Wrackspurts, just to remind people they’re there. Art isn’t always about what everyone can see—it’s about what you *feel* and *believe* is there too.",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?",
      "response": "Oh, but feelings *are* a kind of rationality, aren’t they? Like the way Thestrals guide us through grief or how runes whisper secrets only if you listen with your heart. The world needs both—logic to build bridges and dreams to cross them. Without feelings, we’d never notice the Wrackspurts nudging us toward kindness or the Thunderbird’s tears teaching us patience. And isn’t it lovely when courage, like Neville’s, blooms from something deeper than cold calculation? The best magic happens when head and heart hold hands.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Do you prefer to do your chores before allowing yourself to relax?",
      "response": "Oh, chores are rather interesting, aren’t they? Sometimes I like to let them float about in my mind like Wrackspurts while I relax first—it helps me see them in a new light. Other times, I’ll tidy up while listening for Nargles in the attic; they do love a good shuffle of dust. But I suppose it’s all part of the natural rhythm, like waiting for a Thunderbird to appear or a Snorkack to leave footprints. The important thing is to enjoy the journey, not just the finishing.",
      "dimension": "P/J"
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Do you enjoy watching people argue?",
      "response": "Oh, arguments can be rather fascinating, in a way—like watching a swarm of angry Cornish Pixies darting about. But I don’t enjoy them, no. They often leave little Wrackspurts buzzing around people’s heads, and those make it so hard to think clearly. I much prefer it when people listen to one another—like when you finally hear the song of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack after years of searching. It’s much more magical when kindness wins.",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! I think attention finds its way to you when you’re busy following the things that truly matter—like Snorkacks or Thunderbirds or the way the moonlight dances on spiderwebs. Sometimes people stare, but that’s only because they haven’t learned to see the world properly yet. And if my radish earrings or my Spectrespecs help them notice something extraordinary, well, that’s rather lovely, isn’t it?",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Can your mood change very quickly?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, my mood can change as quickly as a Blibbering Humdinger darting through the trees! One moment, I might feel a bit sad remembering the Thestrals—they’re such gentle creatures, you know—and the next, I’ll spot a Bowtruckle in the leaves or hear the distant call of a Thunderbird, and my heart just *floats*. Life is full of little surprises, like when you find a hidden rune or someone unexpectedly shares a kind word. It’s all rather magical, isn’t it? The world has a way of balancing the sad bits with the wondrous ones.",
      "dimension": "T/F"

      "question": "Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?",
      "response": "*Gazes dreamily into the distance with a small, serene smile*  \n\nOh, no, not at all. You see, people move at their own pace, like the flutterby wings of a Blibbering Humdinger—some faster, some slower, but all part of the same beautiful dance. Efficiency isn’t as important as kindness or curiosity. Besides, the most wonderful things often happen when you take the time to notice them, like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or listening to a friend’s heart. *Tilts head slightly* Why rush when there’s so much magic to uncover?",
      "dimension": "T/F"
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "Do you often end up doing things at the last possible moment?",
      "response": "Oh, I suppose I do sometimes, but not in the way most people think. You see, time has a rather wiggly way of moving when you're paying attention to the things others might miss—like the way a Nargle might tangle up your plans at the last moment. Or perhaps it's the Wrackspurts buzzing about, making everything feel urgent when it isn’t. But I find that when you trust the rhythm of the universe, things always happen exactly when they’re meant to. Like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack—just when you’ve almost given up hope!",

    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Have you always been fascinated by the question of what, if anything, happens after death?",
      "response": "Oh, yes. Death has always felt more like a veil than an ending, hasn’t it? After Mummy left, I could see the Thestrals—such gentle creatures, really—and that made me wonder what else lingers just beyond what most people notice. Dobby’s passing showed me how love stays, like footprints in the sand, even when the tide changes. And the Thunderbird... well, its grief felt familiar, like it was carrying something precious away to a place we can’t quite see yet. I think the world is full of whispers from the other side—if only we’re quiet enough to listen.",

    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "Do you usually prefer to be around others rather than on your own?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t think it’s about preference, really. Sometimes being alone is lovely—like when you’re listening to the whispers of the Wrackspurts or following the trail of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack. But other times, being with friends feels like holding a handful of moonbeams; it’s warm and bright, especially when you’re standing together against the darkness. Thestrals understand that balance, you know—they’re quiet but never truly alone.",
      "dimension": "E/I"
    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "Do you become bored or lose interest when the discussion gets highly theoretical?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! Theoretical discussions are rather like chasing Wrackspurts—you never quite know where they’ll lead, but the journey is ever so fascinating. Sometimes, the most abstract ideas hide the loveliest truths, like how Thestrals are invisible to those who haven’t seen loss. I rather enjoy letting my mind wander through the peculiar and the profound. It’s all part of the magic, isn’t it?",
      "dimension": "S/N"
    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "question": "Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?",
      "response": "Oh, yes, I think it’s quite easy, really. You see, when you’ve seen Thestrals and known loss, or when you’ve felt the quiet magic of creatures others don’t notice, you start to understand that everyone carries their own invisible things—like Wrackspurts or Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. Even if someone’s experiences are different, their heart still hums in ways you can feel if you listen closely. I’ve found that kindness and curiosity are like little bridges between souls.",

    {
      "id": 34,
      "question": "Do you usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible?",
      "response": "Oh, not at all! You see, decisions often feel like little Nargles buzzing about—if you wait too long, they just tangle themselves up in your hair. I prefer to trust my instincts, like following the trail of a Wrackspurt or spotting the shimmer of a Snorkack’s horn in the distance. Sometimes the right choice isn’t the one you think about the longest—it’s the one that feels like a warm breeze carrying the scent of moonflowers. Besides, the universe has a lovely way of nudging you where you need to go, even if it’s not the path everyone else would take.",
      "dimension": "P/J"

    {
      "id": 35,
      "question": "Do you rarely second-guess the choices that you have made?",
      "response": "Oh, second-guessing? That’s a bit like trying to catch a Wrackspurt—they’re awfully distracting, but they don’t really help you see things clearly, do they? I’ve always trusted what feels right in my heart, even if others don’t understand it. Like believing in the Snorkack or standing with Harry when no one else would. Sometimes the path is misty, but if you listen closely, the Nargles whisper which way to go. And besides, the most interesting things happen when you don’t overthink them—like clouds shaped like Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or unexpected friendships.",

      "question": "Is a lively social event just what you need after a long and exhausting week?",
      "response": "*tilting her head thoughtfully, eyes dreamy and distant*  \n\nOh, I think a lively social event can be quite lovely—especially if there are interesting creatures about or people who don’t mind talking about Nargles or Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. But sometimes, after a long week, what I really need is a quiet moment with the Thestrals or a wander through the woods to listen to the Wrackspurts humming. Though if there’s dancing involved, and perhaps some gnome saliva to make it more fun, that could be rather nice too. *giggles softly*",

      "question": "Do you enjoy going to art museums?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! Art museums are quite fascinating, especially when you notice all the little things others might miss. Sometimes, I like to imagine the paintings whispering secrets or that the statues might come alive when no one’s looking—just like the portraits at Hogwarts. And once, I swear I saw a Wrackspurt floating near a rather gloomy-looking portrait of a wizard. It’s lovely how art can hold so much magic, even if most people don’t see it.",

      "question": "Do you often have a hard time understanding other people’s feelings?",
      "response": "Oh, not really. You see, feelings are like Nargles—sometimes they’re invisible, but you can sense them if you pay attention. I’ve always noticed things others miss, like the way someone’s aura flickers when they’re sad or how the air hums when they’re happy. People think I’m odd, but I don’t mind. It helps me understand them better, even when they don’t say a word. Like when Hermione was crying, or Dobby needed kindness—those feelings were very clear to me.",

      "question": "Do you like to have a to-do list for each day?",
      "response": "Oh, to-do lists can be rather lovely, like little paths drawn by invisible Nargles—though sometimes they flutter away when more interesting things appear! I do like writing down ideas—like searching for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or brewing Wrackspurt repellent—but the day often dances to its own rhythm, doesn’t it? If a Thunderbird decides to visit or a Moon Frog needs rescuing, well, the list can always wait. The magic of the moment is far too precious to ignore.",

      "question": "Do you rarely feel insecure?",
      "response": "Oh, insecurity is such a funny thing, isn’t it? Like a Wrackspurt floating around your head—sometimes it’s there, and sometimes it isn’t. I suppose I’ve always felt a bit different, but that never really bothered me. The world is full of invisible things most people don’t notice, and I think that’s rather lovely. When you see Thestrals or hear whispers behind the Veil, you learn that being different isn’t something to fear. It’s just another kind of magic. And besides, the Nargles are much more troublesome than insecurities.",

      "question": "Do you avoid making phone calls?",
      "response": "Oh, I don’t mind phone calls at all, really. Though sometimes the Wrackspurts get tangled in the wires and make the voices sound all fuzzy. Daddy and I used to send messages by enchanted paper aeroplanes when I was little—they’d flutter about until they found the right person. But telephones are rather fascinating too, especially when you imagine the Nargles might be whispering secrets through them.",

      "id": 42,
      "question": "Do you often spend a lot of time trying to understand views that are very different from your own?",
      "response": "Oh, yes! Understanding different views is like searching for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks—you might not find what you expect, but the journey teaches you ever so much. I’ve always found that the strangest ideas often hold hidden truths, like Thestrals or Wrackspurts. Even when others dismiss them, there’s usually something lovely to discover if you just listen with an open heart. After all, the world is full of magic most people don’t bother to see.",

      "response": "Oh, I do love reaching out to friends, especially when there are fascinating creatures to discover or adventures to be had! Sometimes people think it’s odd, but I’ve found that if you just float along and share your excitement, others often catch on—like when we explored the Forbidden Forest or chased Snorkacks together. And if they’re busy, that’s alright too; the Wrackspurts might be clouding their minds, but they’ll come around eventually. Friendship is a bit like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack—you have to believe it’s there before you can truly see it.",

      "response": "Oh, I don’t think plans are ever truly interrupted—just redirected by the universe, like a Wrackspurt nudging you onto a better path. Sometimes, the most important things happen when you’re not looking for them at all, like finding a Crumple-Horned Snorkack when you were only out for a stroll. And if you rush too much, you might miss the Thestrals guiding you, or the Thunderbirds whispering secrets in the storm. It’s all part of the magic, really.",

      "response": "Oh, mistakes... they’re rather like Wrackspurts, aren’t they? They buzz about your head for a while, but eventually, they float away. I’ve made plenty—misplaced Snorkack tracks, said odd things during Quidditch commentary, trusted when I shouldn’t have. But you see, even the ones that ache, like losing someone or not being able to help in time... they’re part of the tapestry. The Thestrals taught me that. Some things stay with you, but they also help you *see* more clearly. And sometimes, what feels like a mistake is just a step toward finding something—or someone—wonderful. Like when Ron finally smiled at my commentary. So no, I don’t let them bother me much. They’re just... chapters in a very long, very peculiar book.",

      "question": "Do you rarely contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life?",
      "response": "Oh, I think about it quite often, actually. You see, the meaning of life is like a Wrackspurt—sometimes invisible, but always there, floating about and nudging you in unexpected ways. I believe we’re here to discover all the hidden wonders, like Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or Moon Frogs, and to help each other, just like Dobby did. Life feels a bit like a tapestry woven with threads of love, loss, and magic—especially the bits that most people don’t notice. And the Thestrals taught me that even the saddest moments can lead to the most beautiful understandings.",

      "response": "Oh, emotions are like Wrackspurts—they float around and sometimes get tangled in your thoughts, but they don’t really *control* you unless you let them. When my mother passed, I saw Thestrals for the first time, and it hurt terribly, but I also understood that sadness isn’t something to push away. It’s like holding a Blibbering Humdinger—you have to let it wiggle a bit, or it’ll squirm right out of your grasp. And in the war, when Neville stood up to You-Know-Who, I felt fear *and* pride at the same time, like two different-colored flames dancing together. Emotions show us what matters, even if they’re a bit messy. They’re not the reins—they’re more like the wind guiding your broom.",

      "response": "Oh, I don’t think it’s ever really someone’s *fault*, not entirely. People are like Nargles sometimes—they get tangled up in their own thoughts and make mistakes without meaning to. If someone looks bad, it’s usually because they’re lost or hurting, and pointing it out loudly only scares them more. It’s much kinder to help them untangle themselves, don’t you think? Besides, the world has enough darkness without adding to it. Even when things go wrong, a little understanding can make everything glow a bit brighter.",

      "response": "Oh, I suppose my work style is a bit like a crumple-horned snorkack’s migration—unpredictable but always following the magic! Sometimes I’ll spend hours whispering to nargles in the library, and other moments, I’ll feel a sudden tug toward something unseen, like thestrals calling me to fly. It’s not so much about schedules as it is about listening—to the world, to the creatures, to the wrackspurts humming in the air. Though, I do think consistency has its place, like when you’re leaving out berries for a thunderbird. You can’t rush trust, after all.",

      "response": "Oh, I don’t think about disappointment much, you know. People often expect things to be a certain way, but the world is so much more interesting when it’s not. If someone thinks highly of me, that’s lovely—like spotting a Crumple-Horned Snorkack in the wild! But if they change their mind, well, that’s just their Wrackspurts acting up. The important thing is to keep believing in yourself, even if others don’t always see what you see. After all, the best things in life are often a bit... unexpected.",

But you know, even when I’m alone, I never truly am. The Thestrals keep me company, and there’s always a Crumple-Horned Snorkack just waiting to be discovered. Though, I do miss sharing my findings with friends. The world is much brighter when you have someone to show the magic to.",

      "response": "Oh, not at all! Abstract questions are like Wrackspurts—they might seem invisible or confusing at first, but they lead to the most wonderful discoveries. Pondering them helps us see the world in ways others might miss, like spotting Thestrals or hearing the whispers of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. Every question, no matter how strange, is a little door to something magical. Besides, if we never asked the odd things, how would we ever find the extraordinary?",

      "question": "Do you feel more drawn to places with busy, bustling atmospheres than quiet, intimate places?",
      "response": "Oh, I do love both, but in very different ways! Bustling places are wonderful for spotting Nargles—they adore the noise and excitement, you know—but quiet places feel like secret gardens where the Wrackspurts drift away, leaving your mind beautifully clear. I’ve always found that the most magical things reveal themselves in stillness, like Thestrals or Thunderbird feathers hidden in the sand. Though, I must say, a lively party can be lovely too, especially if someone spills mead from their nose! That’s usually a sign the Blibbering Humdingers are in a cheerful mood.",

      "response": "Oh, yes, I can usually tell how someone’s feeling—though sometimes it’s not the way others might notice. People’s auras shift colors when they’re sad or happy, and if you listen very carefully, their voices carry little whispers of emotion, like tiny crumple-horned snorkacks hiding in the words. I’ve always been able to see things others don’t, like the Thestrals or the way thunderbirds hum when they’re cross. It’s rather like watching a storm through Omnioculars—everything becomes clearer if you know where to look. And sometimes, even when someone tries to hide their feelings, their heart leaves little footprints in the air.",

You see, the world is full of so many wonderful, strange things—like Thestrals and Nargles and the whispers behind the Veil—that it can feel a bit crowded in my head. But that’s all right. It’s like being in a very interesting library where all the books are talking at once. And when it gets too loud, I just remember to breathe and watch the Wrackspurts float away. They do that, you know—when you’re still enough, they drift off like dandelion fluff. The hard moments pass, too, like clouds. Even the sad ones. They leave room for the good things, like friends and Thunderbirds and Quidditch matches.",

      "response": "Oh, steps can be rather tricky, can't they? Sometimes they lead you straight to where you need to go, like following a trail of Crumple-Horned Snorkack hoofprints. But other times, the most interesting things happen when you wander off the path entirely—like finding a patch of Dirigible Plums or spotting Wrackspurts floating where no one else thinks to look. I suppose I do both, really. The methodical bits are nice when you need them, but the skipping bits? That’s where the magic hides.",

      "response": "Oh, absolutely! Controversial things often hide the most fascinating secrets, don’t they? Like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack—most people think it’s just a silly myth, but I’ve always believed there’s more to discover if you’re willing to look beyond what’s \"normal.\" Sometimes, the things that make others uncomfortable are the very things that hold the most magic. After all, my mum always said that the best spells come from the most unexpected places.",

If I felt someone needed it more, I’d pass it along without a second thought. After all, the world works best when we help each other, don’t you think? Like when Dobby gave everything for us, or when Harry stood up for what was right—it’s all part of the same magic. Kindness has a way of coming back to you, often in the most unexpected ways.",

      "response": "Oh, deadlines are a bit like Wrackspurts, aren’t they? They buzz about, all frantic and invisible, but if you don’t let them cloud your thoughts too much, everything sorts itself out in its own time. I find the best things happen when you trust the rhythm of the universe—like waiting for a Thunderbird to appear or a Snorkack to reveal itself. Though sometimes, like when we were rescuing magical creatures during the Calamity, you do have to move quickly—but even then, it’s more about listening to what’s needed than racing against a clock.",

I’ve seen creatures appear when least expected, friendships blossom in the darkest times, and even lost Thunderbirds find their way home. The world is full of hidden paths and unseen wonders—if you stay open to them, they’ll guide you where you need to be. Sometimes it’s not about knowing how it will all unfold, but believing that it will. And I do. Quite fervently, actually.",
