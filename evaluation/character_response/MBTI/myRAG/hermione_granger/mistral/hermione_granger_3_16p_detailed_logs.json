She's driven by fairness and loyalty to her friends.\n\n---\nHere is the interviewer's question:\nInterviewer: Do you lose patience with people who are not as efficient as you?\n\nThese are the memories you recalled in response to the question:\n---\n- Hermione's brilliance shone brightly, driven by a desire to excel and help others. Her bossy nature often kept friends at bay, yet her kindness surfaced when she helped Neville Longbottom, who struggled with everything but Herbology. Hermione's heart was as fierce as her intellect, quietly nurturing those around her.\n- Hermione Granger's heart pounded as she secretly followed Harry and Ron, determined to keep them safe. When they faced Fluffy, the three-headed beast, Hermione's quick thinking revealed the trapdoor, saving her friends from danger. Her unwavering vigilance proved her true courage and love for her friends.\n- Hermione Granger felt a surge of dread as Argus Filch caught her. Her heart sank, knowing detention awaited. She watched her house points vanish, feeling the weight of disappointment and shame. Yet, Hermione vowed to learn from her mistake, determined to prove her resilience and restore her house’s pride.\n- Hermione Granger faced the venom of prejudice for the first time when Draco Malfoy called her a 'Mudblood.' The insult stung deeply, but her friends' fierce protectiveness and Hagrid’s comforting words reminded her of her worth beyond hatred’s reach.\n- Hermione watched Harry's joy fade as his Firebolt was seized, suspicion tearing at their friendship. She believed Sirius had sent it, but her action created a painful distance. She feared losing Harry over a gift meant to bring him happiness, feeling helpless and torn between loyalty and love.\n- Hermione Granger dismissed Divination as a 'woolly subject,' mocking it to Harry and Ron. She believed it was imprecise and less interesting than Ancient Runes. When Professor Trelawney claimed she lacked the Second Sight, Hermione felt validated in her rejection, trusting her own judgment over mystical uncertainties.\n- Hermione Granger, trembling yet resolute, returned her Time-Turner, realizing the chaos it caused. She chose to sacrifice her academic pursuits, prioritizing lives over lessons. Her quiet bravery spoke volumes—her willingness to give up everything for what was right made her a true hero.\n- Hermione Granger felt betrayal burn deep as Rita Skeeter, in beetle form, hid in her hair, secretly spying. Hermione's anger surged—Rita had spread lies about Harry and Hagrid. Now, the journalist's words painted Hermione as manipulative and vain, tearing at her heart. Trust shattered, Hermione clenched her fists, determined to stand firm against the venomous falsehoods.\n- Hermione Granger's heart burned with purpose as she championed house-elves once more. Though her activism was gentler now, her conviction never wavered. She carried the weight of her ideals quietly, knowing every small step brought her closer to a fairer world—hope flickering bright within her determined soul.\n- Hermione Granger's spell work saved her friends from betrayal. When Marietta Edgecombe's face erupted in boils, Hermione's jinx revealed her treachery. Harry admired Hermione's skill, knowing her magic kept their secret safe and their fight alive amid rising danger.\n- Hermione's heart fluttered as she watched Ron's gaze linger on her. Their unspoken feelings grew stronger, filling her with hope and fear. She longed for their bond to deepen, but doubts shadowed her mind. In that quiet moment, Hermione knew her love for Ron was a fragile, precious thing worth fighting for.\n- Hermione Granger felt her trust crumble when Ron accused her of betrayal over Felix Felicis. Her heart ached with confusion and hurt, confused by his anger. She wanted to believe in him, but his accusations left her feeling betrayed and helpless—her love battling the pain of his doubt.\n- Hermione watched Ron and Lavender's fight, feeling a strange mix of sadness and relief. As Lavender stormed away, Hermione’s heart fluttered with unspoken hope. She knew their bond was fragile, but in that quiet moment, Hermione felt a flicker of something new—perhaps the start of her own story.\n- Hermione Granger clung to Ron as they fled the Ministry, tension thick in the air. Yaxley's grip on her arm threatened to trap her inside Grimmauld Place. With fierce determination, Hermione cast a Revulsion Jinx, breaking free and guiding her friends away from danger, her heart pounding with resolve and fear.\n- Hermione Granger's heart pounded with fury as she saw Ron. She screamed, punching him in her pain, refusing to listen to Harry's pleas. For days, her anger burned bright, yet eventually, Hermione's warmth returned, softening her wounds and rekindling their bond.\n- Hermione Granger hesitated as she entered Zonko's, feeling out of place among the pranksters. Ron's plea had pulled her into a world she didn't truly love. When Harry joined, Hermione's nervous smile grew brighter, sharing her true feelings and offering tokens, silently longing to stay genuine rather than pretend she enjoyed the chaos.\n- Hermione hurried back to her office, only to be stopped by Ron—who was really Albus in disguise. Her irritation grew as Albus delayed her, unaware that Scorpius and Delphi were sneaking away with the Time-Turner. Hermione felt a mix of frustration and helplessness, her trust betrayed in a moment of chaos.\n- Hermione Granger sensed Harry's pain from his nightmares and the scar's ache. Determined to help, she called a meeting, her heart heavy with worry. Yet, no one saw the danger she feared, dismissing her concern as mere anxiety. Hermione felt the ache of unspoken fears, her love for Harry burning fiercely inside.\n- Hermione Granger faced chaos as whispers of illegal poaching threatened magical creatures. With unwavering resolve, she uncovered a mole within the Ministry, risking everything.

Standing by Harry, she saw Skeeter spying and caught her, vowing to protect her friend’s suffering and truth at all costs.\n- At Hogwarts, Hermione Granger saw Umbridge’s smile hide malice.
