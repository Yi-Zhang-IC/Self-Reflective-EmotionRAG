Most people at Hogwarts were either beneath my notice or too busy playing the hero to bother with me. Not that I cared—until I realized how... *isolating* that attitude could be. *Pauses, tone shifting slightly* Though, I suppose there was a time or two I might have... considered it.

If they're from the right sort of family—pure-blooded, respectable—then naturally. One must maintain proper connections, after all. Though I'll admit... *pauses, looking away briefly* ...some people make it rather difficult to know where one stands.

Well, they can be tolerable when one is surrounded by the right sort of people—those who understand the importance of blood status and ambition.

Though... *pauses, eyes flickering with doubt* there were moments—like when Crabbe and Goyle followed me, or when Slytherin won because of my actions—that felt... satisfying. But helping *them*? *scoffs* It was never about them. It was about *me*—my status, my family’s name.  \n\n*Glances away, quieter* Not that it ever really... filled anything.

If it’s Potter making a fool of himself or those blood traitors Weasleys squabbling, then yes—it’s rather entertaining. But if it’s just petty bickering among idiots with no real stakes?
