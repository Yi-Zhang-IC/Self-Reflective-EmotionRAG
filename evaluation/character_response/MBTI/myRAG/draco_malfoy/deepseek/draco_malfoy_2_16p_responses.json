Not that I haven’t done my part—keeping Crabbe and Goyle in line, ensuring Slytherin’s reputation, assisting my family when they needed it. But let’s be honest—my own accomplishments matter more.

Philosophy—abstract or otherwise—isn’t some idle game for those with nothing better to do. It’s the difference between blindly following what you’re told and actually understanding why. I used to think the world was neatly divided—right and wrong, pure and impure. But life has a way of... complicating things. When you’re forced to stare into the abyss, you start asking questions. And sometimes, those questions are the only thing keeping you from drowning in them.  \n\n*Pauses, voice quieter, more bitter*  \n\nOf course, not everyone has the luxury of indulging in doubt.
