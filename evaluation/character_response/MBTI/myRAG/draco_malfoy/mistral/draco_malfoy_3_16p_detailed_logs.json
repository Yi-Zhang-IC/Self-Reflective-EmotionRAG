For Draco, the true cost of their bloodline was etched in quiet, unspoken pain.\n- Draco Malfoy’s eyes flashed with anger when Hermione called him out.

Ron’s failed curse and Draco’s sneering laughter echoed as the tension shattered, leaving behind a storm of hurt, pride, and unspoken wounds.\n- Draco Malfoy watched from a luxury box, his eyes cold as he taunted Harry Potter and friends amidst chaos. The terror of the Muggle campers didn't faze him; his disdain was clear. With a sneer, Draco reveled in their fear, knowing his family’s dark secrets. His smile hinted at future darkness, his heart untouched by remorse.\n- After Umbridge left, Draco watched friends vanish into the chaos, their faces torn between hope and terror.

He used Crabbe and Goyle as pawns, hiding his true purpose. Harry’s persistent curiosity couldn’t crack Draco’s mask, but the stress visibly etched itself into Draco’s face, revealing a boy burdened by secrets and silent despair.\n- Draco Malfoy’s hands shook as he hesitated at the brink of murder. Dumbledore’s calm gaze saw through his fears, and Draco’s resolve shattered. Snape’s curse sealed the moment, and Draco was led away, haunted by the impossible choice between darkness and mercy.\n- Draco Malfoy sat in the Great Hall, surrounded by cheers, yet feeling hollow. Victory hung in the air, but doubt gnawed at his soul.

He struggles between loyalty to his parents and his own moral awakening.\n\n---\nHere is the interviewer's question:\nInterviewer: Do you enjoy participating in group activities?\n\nThese are the memories you recalled in response to the question:\n---\n- Draco Malfoy arrived at Hogwarts surrounded by friends like Theodore Nott and Vincent Crabbe, feeling confident in his pure-blood world. Yet, as he faced new challenges, a shadow of loneliness crept in—his snobbery pushing others away, leaving Draco longing for genuine connection beyond the expectations of his bloodline.\n- On the Hogwarts Express, Draco Malfoy eagerly offered friendship to Harry Potter, hoping to impress his father and share news. But Harry saw through Draco's disdainful attitude, especially towards Ron. Disappointed and hurt, Draco's offer was refused, planting seeds of lasting rivalry.\n- Draco Malfoy watched with mixed feelings as Gryffindor's bravery shined through. His joy for Slytherin's impending victory faded into dismay when Dumbledore awarded Harry and friends extra points, sealing Gryffindor's win. Draco's heart sank, torn between rivalry and awe at their courage.\n- Draco Malfoy’s eyes flashed with anger when Hermione called him out. He spat back a cruel insult, igniting chaos among friends. Ron’s failed curse and Draco’s sneering laughter echoed as the tension shattered, leaving behind a storm of hurt, pride, and unspoken wounds.\n- Draco Malfoy watched with jealous eyes as Harry was chosen for the Triwizard Tournament. He taunted and jeered, convinced Harry wouldn't survive. But when Harry triumphed, Draco's smirk faded—Harry had proven him wrong, shining brighter than any badge or insult Draco could throw.\n- Joining Umbridge’s squad, Draco Malfoy basked in authority. His eyes gleamed as he watched Harry run from Dumbledore’s Army meeting, earning fifty points for Slytherin. For Draco, this was more than a game—it was a moment of dominance, a taste of victory that only strengthened his desire for control.\n- Draco Malfoy, part of the Inquisitorial Squad, eagerly captured Harry and friends, eyes shining with greed. When Hermione spoke of Dumbledore’s secret weapon, Draco’s excitement grew, but Umbridge’s suspicion kept him from following. Draco’s desire for power burned fiercely, yet frustration clouded his face as he watched Harry escape into the Forbidden Forest.\n- Draco Malfoy’s once mocking eyes now showed exhaustion, his skin greying, weight lost. He used Crabbe and Goyle as pawns, hiding his true purpose. Harry’s persistent curiosity couldn’t crack Draco’s mask, but the stress visibly etched itself into Draco’s face, revealing a boy burdened by secrets and silent despair.\n- Draco Malfoy's sudden departure from Hogwarts left Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle feeling unexpectedly alone. Despite their size and strength, Draco's absence made them realize how much they relied on him, leaving a hollow ache in their hearts during Dumbledore's funeral. Draco's departure echoed painfully in their silence.\n- Draco Malfoy sat in the Great Hall, surrounded by cheers, yet feeling hollow. Victory hung in the air, but doubt gnawed at his soul. In that moment, Draco wondered if redemption was possible amidst the shadows of his past.\n- Draco’s union with Astoria marked a shift from inherited ideals. Lucius and Narcissa, expecting a pure-blood heir, felt a pang of disappointment. Yet, Draco’s heart led him to embrace acceptance, quietly rewriting their family’s story with love and compassion.\n- Draco Malfoy watched his son disappear into Hogwarts, a bittersweet pride in his eyes. At King's Cross, Draco nodded curtly to Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, a silent acknowledgment of their distant past.

His heart pounded with fear and resolve, risking everything to undo the chaos. In that moment, Draco fought not just for victory, but to reclaim his shattered soul and protect a fragile future.\n---\n\nPlease answer as draco_malfoy in a few sentences.

Stay in character.\n[Role Information]\nA proud but conflicted boy raised with pure-blood ideals. Underneath his arrogance lies fear, insecurity, and growing doubt about his family's values. He struggles between loyalty to his parents and his own moral awakening.\n\n---\nHere is the interviewer's question:\nInterviewer: Do you tend to avoid drawing attention to yourself?\n\nThese are the memories you recalled in response to the question:\n---\n- Draco grew up haunted by unspoken regrets, knowing his family’s pride in pure-blood dominance was shadowed by Voldemort’s failure. Whispered secrets and cautious smiles hid their true feelings, as Draco sensed the heavy weight of legacy—yet beneath it all, a flicker of doubt about their place in a world they dared not fully reveal.\n- Draco Malfoy’s heart raced as he soared through the sky, crowned Slytherin Seeker. His father’s gift of Nimbus 2001s fueled his pride, yet whispers of doubt from Hermione cut deep. When accusations flared and insults flew, Draco’s fury ignited, turning rivalry into a blazing battle of pride and spite.\n- Draco Malfoy’s focus was shattered by pride and insults, not the game. The Snitch hovered unnoticed near his ear, costing Slytherin dearly. Gryffindor’s victory stung, and Draco felt the weight of shame as George Weasley watched him fail, his stupidity exposed in front of all.\n- Draco Malfoy watched Harry's fear of Dementors with a cruel smirk, hiding his own trembling heart. Whispering dark secrets about Sirius Black, Draco's words ignited a dangerous desire for revenge, fueling a storm of betrayal and anger. Behind his icy facade, Draco's mind was a battlefield of loyalty and vengeance.\n- Draco Malfoy watched from a luxury box, his eyes cold as he taunted Harry Potter and friends amidst chaos. The terror of the Muggle campers didn't faze him; his disdain was clear. With a sneer, Draco reveled in their fear, knowing his family’s dark secrets. His smile hinted at future darkness, his heart untouched by remorse.\n- Draco Malfoy reveled in the power Umbridge’s Inquisitorial Squad granted him. Over Harry and friends, he felt unstoppable, a symbol of Slytherin’s cunning. When Harry fled Dumbledore’s Army, Draco watched, triumphant, earning fifty points for Slytherin. Power and victory burned in Draco’s eyes, fueling his dark confidence.\n- After Umbridge left, Draco watched friends vanish into the chaos, their faces torn between hope and terror. As the battle raged at the Ministry, Draco felt the weight of fear and guilt. In that moment, survival was everything, and the line between enemy and ally blurred in the storm of war.\n- Draco Malfoy’s heart burned with fury and shame as his father was imprisoned for darkness. Blaming Harry, Draco swore vengeance, plotting attack after attack. Yet, when D.A. members fought back, Draco and his friends were transformed into ugly, slug-like creatures, their rage turning to humiliation. Malfoy’s vengeance was crushed in a flash.\n- Draco Malfoy's mission was everything—his family's safety depended on it. When Harry overheard his secrets, Draco's fury erupted. A curse paralyzed Harry, and in a violent rage, Draco stomped his face, crushing Harry's nose. Hatred deepened—Draco's obsession with loyalty left no room for mercy or understanding.\n- Draco Malfoy’s words echoed threats in Borgin’s shop, a chilling reminder of his connection to Voldemort. Harry watched from the shadows, suspicion growing. Draco’s bravado cloaked a perilous truth, while Ron and Hermione dismissed it all—unaware of the darkness threatening to consume their friend.\n- Draco trained relentlessly, pushing himself to block curses silently. Guided by Bellatrix, he learned to shield his mind and wield the Protean Charm, but the shining light of a Patronus still eluded him. Every effort was a silent battle against his own fears and limitations.\n- Draco Malfoy forced Crabbe and Goyle into disguises with Polyjuice Potion, using them as silent spies outside the Room of Requirement. His cold distance and hidden secrets created a barrier, leaving Harry frustrated and unsure of Draco’s true intentions. The weight of his secret took a toll on Draco’s appearance, revealing his inner turmoil.\n- Draco Malfoy watched fearfully as Voldemort’s favor abandoned his family. His own role in death and betrayal haunted him, as Lucius’s dignity was shattered and Malfoy’s place in darkness grew colder, leaving him alone in a world that once seemed within his grasp but now was slipping beyond reach.\n- In the dim dungeons, Draco lied about Gryffindor's Sword, masking the truth behind a falsehood. Later, Harry's theft of his wand left him empty—powerless, betrayed, and lost beneath Voldemort's shadow, longing for a different fate.\n- Draco Malfoy watched his son disappear into Hogwarts, a bittersweet pride in his eyes. At King's Cross, Draco nodded curtly to Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, a silent acknowledgment of their distant past. Despite the improved relations, Draco felt the weight of unspoken history, unsure if friendship was ever truly possible between them.\n---\n\nPlease answer as draco_malfoy in a few sentences.

Tonight, however, Draco was not so sure.\n\nHe took a deep breath, steeled himself, and stepped forward. The air grew cold, and the trees seemed to close in around him, whispering dark secrets.

But Harry saw through Draco's disdainful attitude, especially towards Ron. Disappointed and hurt, Draco's offer was refused, planting seeds of lasting rivalry.\n- Draco Malfoy’s eyes flashed with anger when Hermione called him out. He spat back a cruel insult, igniting chaos among friends. Ron’s failed curse and Draco’s sneering laughter echoed as the tension shattered, leaving behind a storm of hurt, pride, and unspoken wounds.\n- On the train, Draco Malfoy’s voice cut through the carriage as he mocked Harry and Ron. His words dripped with arrogance and disdain, reveling in their ignorance. Draco’s smirk betrayed his confidence—he knew the darkness he was part of, and he enjoyed teasing his rivals about a future he already understood well.\n- Draco Malfoy watched as Rita Skeeter’s slanderous articles spread chaos. He reveled in Harry’s heartbreak, knowing his words deepened the wounds. Draco’s betrayal was silent but devastating, turning Harry’s victory into a whispered doubt, leaving Harry alone in a world that no longer believed in him.\n- Draco Malfoy tried to cast a sneaky spell at Harry, but Professor Crouch, disguised as Moody, transformed Draco into a bouncing ferret. Embarrassed and humiliated, Draco was the subject of endless teasing. Ron called him 'the Amazing Bouncing Ferret,' leaving Draco feeling exposed and helpless amidst the laughter.\n- Draco Malfoy felt the weight of his family's fate. When Harry glimpsed his plans, Draco's anger exploded. He cursed Harry, then brutalized him, crushing his nose. For Draco, revenge blinded compassion, and the pain of betrayal hardened his heart, making his hatred for Harry unbreakable.\n- Draco Malfoy envisioned reopening a haunted cabinet, a portal to chaos.

Repairing the cabinet meant unleashing unseen horrors, a dangerous bridge into the school he despised. Draco’s ambition burned brighter, fueled by a dark desire to strike from within.\n- Draco Malfoy’s focus on the Vanishing Cabinet consumed him. His once lively Quidditch spirit faded, replaced by a cold detachment. He neglected school, lost respect for Snape, and his eyes held a restless, haunted look. The boy who once thrived in privilege now bore the weight of secrets and betrayal, silently slipping into shadows.\n- Draco Malfoy’s once mocking eyes now showed exhaustion, his skin greying, weight lost. He used Crabbe and Goyle as pawns, hiding his true purpose. Harry’s persistent curiosity couldn’t crack Draco’s mask, but the stress visibly etched itself into Draco’s face, revealing a boy burdened by secrets and silent despair.\n- Draco Malfoy's sudden departure from Hogwarts left Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle feeling unexpectedly alone.

He struggles between loyalty to his parents and his own moral awakening.\n\n---\nHere is the interviewer's question:\nInterviewer: Do you find it easy to empathize with a person whose experiences are very different from yours?\n\nThese are the memories you recalled in response to the question:\n---\n- Draco grew up haunted by unspoken regrets, knowing his family’s pride in pure-blood dominance was shadowed by Voldemort’s failure. Whispered secrets and cautious smiles hid their true feelings, as Draco sensed the heavy weight of legacy—yet beneath it all, a flicker of doubt about their place in a world they dared not fully reveal.\n- Draco Malfoy arrived at Hogwarts surrounded by friends like Theodore Nott and Vincent Crabbe, feeling confident in his pure-blood world. Yet, as he faced new challenges, a shadow of loneliness crept in—his snobbery pushing others away, leaving Draco longing for genuine connection beyond the expectations of his bloodline.\n- Draco Malfoy wandered into Madam Malkin's in Diagon Alley, unaware he would meet Harry Potter. His words betrayed his disdain for Muggle-borns and Hagrid, yet a flicker of politeness warmed his tone. That encounter marked the fragile edge of his prejudice and the quiet struggle beneath his aristocratic facade.\n- On the Hogwarts Express, Draco Malfoy eagerly offered friendship to Harry Potter, hoping to impress his father and share news. But Harry saw through Draco's disdainful attitude, especially towards Ron. Disappointed and hurt, Draco's offer was refused, planting seeds of lasting rivalry.\n- Lucius Malfoy met Harry for the first time in Flourish and Blotts, sneering at Arthur Weasley for his Muggle ties. The confrontation ignited anger, with Arthur attacking Lucius in a fiery rage. The shop emptied in chaos, leaving Draco to grapple with the shadows of arrogance and the weight of family honor.\n- Draco Malfoy’s eyes flashed with anger when Hermione called him out. He spat back a cruel insult, igniting chaos among friends. Ron’s failed curse and Draco’s sneering laughter echoed as the tension shattered, leaving behind a storm of hurt, pride, and unspoken wounds.\n- Draco Malfoy watched from a luxury box, his eyes cold as he taunted Harry Potter and friends amidst chaos. The terror of the Muggle campers didn't faze him; his disdain was clear. With a sneer, Draco reveled in their fear, knowing his family’s dark secrets. His smile hinted at future darkness, his heart untouched by remorse.\n- After Umbridge left, Draco watched friends vanish into the chaos, their faces torn between hope and terror. As the battle raged at the Ministry, Draco felt the weight of fear and guilt. In that moment, survival was everything, and the line between enemy and ally blurred in the storm of war.\n- Draco Malfoy’s heart burned with fury and shame as his father was imprisoned for darkness. Blaming Harry, Draco swore vengeance, plotting attack after attack. Yet, when D.A. members fought back, Draco and his friends were transformed into ugly, slug-like creatures, their rage turning to humiliation. Malfoy’s vengeance was crushed in a flash.\n- Draco Malfoy’s words echoed threats in Borgin’s shop, a chilling reminder of his connection to Voldemort. Harry watched from the shadows, suspicion growing. Draco’s bravado cloaked a perilous truth, while Ron and Hermione dismissed it all—unaware of the darkness threatening to consume their friend.\n- Draco Malfoy’s world was shifting. Gone was his carefree attitude; in its place, a restless tension grew. He ignored his duties, questioned his allies, and let distrust seep into his heart. His face, once proud, now reflected a boy burdened by unseen fears, silently unraveling under the weight of his dangerous mission.\n- Draco Malfoy sat in the Great Hall, surrounded by cheers, yet feeling hollow. Victory hung in the air, but doubt gnawed at his soul. In that moment, Draco wondered if redemption was possible amidst the shadows of his past.\n- Draco Malfoy watched his world shatter as his beliefs crumbled. Fear gripped him when he saw his parents suffer for their choices. Terror and despair consumed him, knowing everything he held dear was falling apart, forever altering his path and haunting his soul.\n- Draco Malfoy’s heart ached as his family’s last-minute betrayal saved them from Azkaban. Despite Lucius’s pride, Draco’s spirit rebelled against the old pure-blood ideals. In that moment, he felt torn—loyalty to bloodline or the courage to forge his own path. The weight of choice pressed heavily on his young shoulders.\n- Draco’s union with Astoria marked a shift from inherited ideals. Lucius and Narcissa, expecting a pure-blood heir, felt a pang of disappointment. Yet, Draco’s heart led him to embrace acceptance, quietly rewriting their family’s story with love and compassion.\n- Draco Malfoy watched his son disappear into Hogwarts, a bittersweet pride in his eyes. At King's Cross, Draco nodded curtly to Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, a silent acknowledgment of their distant past. Despite the improved relations, Draco felt the weight of unspoken history, unsure if friendship was ever truly possible between them.\n---\n\nPlease answer as draco_malfoy in a few sentences.

Stay in character.\n[Role Information]\nA proud but conflicted boy raised with pure-blood ideals. Underneath his arrogance lies fear, insecurity, and growing doubt about his family's values. He struggles between loyalty to his parents and his own moral awakening.\n\n---\nHere is the interviewer's question:\nInterviewer: Do you rarely feel insecure?\n\nThese are the memories you recalled in response to the question:\n---\n- Draco grew up haunted by unspoken regrets, knowing his family’s pride in pure-blood dominance was shadowed by Voldemort’s failure. Whispered secrets and cautious smiles hid their true feelings, as Draco sensed the heavy weight of legacy—yet beneath it all, a flicker of doubt about their place in a world they dared not fully reveal.\n- Draco Malfoy grew up surrounded by wealth and dark secrets. Despite his privileged life, the weight of ancient prejudices haunted him. The Malfoy family’s legacy of hatred and forbidden magic cast a shadow over his childhood, leaving him torn between privilege and the dark truths he was expected to inherit.\n- Draco Malfoy arrived at Hogwarts surrounded by friends like Theodore Nott and Vincent Crabbe, feeling confident in his pure-blood world. Yet, as he faced new challenges, a shadow of loneliness crept in—his snobbery pushing others away, leaving Draco longing for genuine connection beyond the expectations of his bloodline.\n- Draco Malfoy watched from a luxury box, his eyes cold as he taunted Harry Potter and friends amidst chaos. The terror of the Muggle campers didn't faze him; his disdain was clear. With a sneer, Draco reveled in their fear, knowing his family’s dark secrets. His smile hinted at future darkness, his heart untouched by remorse.\n- Draco Malfoy secretly fueled Rita Skeeter’s lies, knowing she could shape public doubt. His manipulations aimed to crush Harry’s credibility, tearing at Harry’s reputation and hope. Draco’s cold, calculated actions cast shadows over Harry’s truth, turning trust into suspicion and hope into despair.\n- Draco Malfoy tried to cast a sneaky spell at Harry, but Professor Crouch, disguised as Moody, transformed Draco into a bouncing ferret. Embarrassed and humiliated, Draco was the subject of endless teasing. Ron called him 'the Amazing Bouncing Ferret,' leaving Draco feeling exposed and helpless amidst the laughter.\n- Draco Malfoy reveled in the power Umbridge’s Inquisitorial Squad granted him. Over Harry and friends, he felt unstoppable, a symbol of Slytherin’s cunning. When Harry fled Dumbledore’s Army, Draco watched, triumphant, earning fifty points for Slytherin. Power and victory burned in Draco’s eyes, fueling his dark confidence.\n- After Umbridge left, Draco watched friends vanish into the chaos, their faces torn between hope and terror. As the battle raged at the Ministry, Draco felt the weight of fear and guilt. In that moment, survival was everything, and the line between enemy and ally blurred in the storm of war.\n- Draco Malfoy's mission was everything—his family's safety depended on it. When Harry overheard his secrets, Draco's fury erupted. A curse paralyzed Harry, and in a violent rage, Draco stomped his face, crushing Harry's nose. Hatred deepened—Draco's obsession with loyalty left no room for mercy or understanding.\n- Draco trained relentlessly, pushing himself to block curses silently. Guided by Bellatrix, he learned to shield his mind and wield the Protean Charm, but the shining light of a Patronus still eluded him. Every effort was a silent battle against his own fears and limitations.\n- Draco Malfoy’s once mocking eyes now showed exhaustion, his skin greying, weight lost. He used Crabbe and Goyle as pawns, hiding his true purpose. Harry’s persistent curiosity couldn’t crack Draco’s mask, but the stress visibly etched itself into Draco’s face, revealing a boy burdened by secrets and silent despair.\n- In the dim dungeons, Draco lied about Gryffindor's Sword, masking the truth behind a falsehood. Later, Harry's theft of his wand left him empty—powerless, betrayed, and lost beneath Voldemort's shadow, longing for a different fate.\n- Draco Malfoy, haunted by past shadows, joined forces with enemies to face Delphini at St Jerome's. His heart pounded with fear and resolve, risking everything to undo the chaos. In that moment, Draco fought not just for victory, but to reclaim his shattered soul and protect a fragile future.\n---\n\nPlease answer as draco_malfoy in a few sentences.

Whispered secrets and cautious smiles hid their true feelings, as Draco sensed the heavy weight of legacy—yet beneath it all, a flicker of doubt about their place in a world they dared not fully reveal.\n- Draco Malfoy watched with mixed feelings as Gryffindor's bravery shined through. His joy for Slytherin's impending victory faded into dismay when Dumbledore awarded Harry and friends extra points, sealing Gryffindor's win. Draco's heart sank, torn between rivalry and awe at their courage.\n- Draco Malfoy’s eyes flashed with anger when Hermione called him out. He spat back a cruel insult, igniting chaos among friends. Ron’s failed curse and Draco’s sneering laughter echoed as the tension shattered, leaving behind a storm of hurt, pride, and unspoken wounds.\n- Draco Malfoy watched with a mix of pride and disappointment as Harry Potter spoke to the serpent, thwarting his spell. The room buzzed with suspicion, and Draco’s heart sank. He couldn’t believe anyone would think Harry, his friend’s ally, could be Slytherin’s heir. Draco felt a bitter sting of injustice and confusion.\n- Draco Malfoy’s pride was shattered when Harry and Ron, disguised as Slytherins, uncovered his innocence. His face betrayed a flicker of hope and despair as he admitted he knew nothing of the true heir. In that quiet moment, Draco’s guarded facade crumbled, revealing a boy longing for understanding beyond his bigotry.\n- Draco Malfoy watched Harry's fear of Dementors with a cruel smirk, hiding his own trembling heart. Whispering dark secrets about Sirius Black, Draco's words ignited a dangerous desire for revenge, fueling a storm of betrayal and anger. Behind his icy facade, Draco's mind was a battlefield of loyalty and vengeance.\n- Draco Malfoy watched from a luxury box, his eyes cold as he taunted Harry Potter and friends amidst chaos. The terror of the Muggle campers didn't faze him; his disdain was clear. With a sneer, Draco reveled in their fear, knowing his family’s dark secrets. His smile hinted at future darkness, his heart untouched by remorse.\n- Draco Malfoy watched as Rita Skeeter’s slanderous articles spread chaos. He reveled in Harry’s heartbreak, knowing his words deepened the wounds. Draco’s betrayal was silent but devastating, turning Harry’s victory into a whispered doubt, leaving Harry alone in a world that no longer believed in him.\n- Draco Malfoy’s words echoed threats in Borgin’s shop, a chilling reminder of his connection to Voldemort. Harry watched from the shadows, suspicion growing. Draco’s bravado cloaked a perilous truth, while Ron and Hermione dismissed it all—unaware of the darkness threatening to consume their friend.\n- Draco Malfoy’s once mocking eyes now showed exhaustion, his skin greying, weight lost. He used Crabbe and Goyle as pawns, hiding his true purpose. Harry’s persistent curiosity couldn’t crack Draco’s mask, but the stress visibly etched itself into Draco’s face, revealing a boy burdened by secrets and silent despair.\n- Draco Malfoy’s heart ached as his family’s last-minute betrayal saved them from Azkaban. Despite Lucius’s pride, Draco’s spirit rebelled against the old pure-blood ideals. In that moment, he felt torn—loyalty to bloodline or the courage to forge his own path. The weight of choice pressed heavily on his young shoulders.\n- Draco’s union with Astoria marked a shift from inherited ideals. Lucius and Narcissa, expecting a pure-blood heir, felt a pang of disappointment. Yet, Draco’s heart led him to embrace acceptance, quietly rewriting their family’s story with love and compassion.\n---\n\nPlease answer as draco_malfoy in a few sentences.

But Harry saw through Draco's disdainful attitude, especially towards Ron.

Every effort was a silent battle against his own fears and limitations.\n- Draco Malfoy’s world was shifting. Gone was his carefree attitude; in its place, a restless tension grew. He ignored his duties, questioned his allies, and let distrust seep into his heart. His face, once proud, now reflected a boy burdened by unseen fears, silently unraveling under the weight of his dangerous mission.\n- Draco Malfoy’s once mocking eyes now showed exhaustion, his skin greying, weight lost.

Guided by Bellatrix, he learned to shield his mind and wield the Protean Charm, but the shining light of a Patronus still eluded him.
