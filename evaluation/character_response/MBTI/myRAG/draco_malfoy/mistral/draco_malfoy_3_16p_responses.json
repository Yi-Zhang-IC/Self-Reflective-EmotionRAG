      "response": "Of course, I'm happy to help! It looks like we have a few different memories related to Draco Malfoy's priorities and his experiences with setbacks and interruptions.

A Malfoy doesn't just let setbacks derail him. But, I must admit, there have been times when I let my emotions get the better of me, and I've learned from those mistakes.\n\n(End of assistant's response)",
